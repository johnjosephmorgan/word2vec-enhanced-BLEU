\subsection{Previous Work}
\label{sec:prevwork}


\subsubsection{BLEU}
\label{sec:bleu}


Advantages
quick
inexpensive
language-independent
correlates highly with human evaluation
has little marginal cost per run
Best at parameter optimization
BLEU is well known to have weaknesses. 
Work has been done to remedy these weaknesses by incorporating llinguistic features into the evaluation metric. 
These enhancements make the metrics more accurate and correlate more with human judgements.
Precision and Recall
Bleu computes precision for ngrams matches for n between 1 and 4. 

\subsubsection{METEOR}
\label{sec:meteor}


Meteor is an evaluation metric that takes into consideration stem, synonym, and paraphrase matches between words inaddition to exact string matches.
Enhancements:
Porter Stemming.
Words  are determined to  be synonyms if they share a synset in Wordnet. 
Function word discounting.

These enhancements yielded improvements over bleu, but they are language dependent. 
later versions have incorporated methods for adapting METEOR to new languages. 
Meteor extends BLEU by incorporating semantic features into the evaluation of SMT output. 
We similarly enhance BLEU with semantic knowledge by replacing words in the reference transcriptions with words that are close in meaning.

\subsubsection{TERP}
\label{sec:terp}


TERP builds on Translation Edit Rate (TER), which is a metric that uses the minimum edit distance to score translations. 
TERP inherits the two stemming and synonym enhancements from meteor. 
TERP takes a step up from comparing words with equivalent meaning    (synonyms) to comparing phrases with equivalent meaning (paraphrases). 
TERP is also grounded in human judgements. 
The scoring function parameters, that is, the weights associated with the diffferent edit operations, are optimized  to correlate with the  editing operations performed by humans. 
TERP also produces as a byproduct an alignment between the hypothesis and reference. 

\subsubsection{HyTER}
\label{sec:hyter}


Dreyer and Marcu's work  on HyTER  solves the reference posity problem by employing human annotators to write alternative translations for phrases. 
The phrases are compiled into Recursive Transition Networks that encode an exponential number of reference sentences. 
It has been shown that HyTER is better at differentiating human from machine translation than bleu, terp, and meteor. 
HyTER also ranks machine translation systems performance better than these metrics, where the correct ranking is given by human judgements. 
HyTER also outperforms the other automatic methods as corpus size decreases   from document to sentence. 
In summary, HyTER has clear advantages over other automatic metrics. 
However,   HyTER has one disadvantage we want to avoid. 
The process of creating the meaning equivalent networks used by HyTER requires a prohibitively large amount of human labor. 

We provide background on the method of semantic vector spaces, distributional representation semantics, and deep learning that we rely on to obtain word synonyms and meaning equivalent phrases and sentences. 
We devote a section to our method incorporating synonyms into bleu. 
We discuss our methods for scoring phrases and sentences in two sections. 
Distributional Representational Semantics
We use the Word2vec  tool. 
The modification will consist of  passing the system hypothesis through word2vec to generate candidate synonyms together with smoothing factors.
We will also use this method to generate reference sentences with similar meaning to a given reference sentence.
The word2vec tool is used to build a vector space word distribution model of the target language. 
Then a distance function defined in the vector space is used to generate a neighborhood of words that are close to the words in the reference transcriptions. 
Word2vec only has one language-dependent requirement:a large monolingual corpus of text. 
It does not require a parser, a stemmer, or a part of speech tagger. 
The representations of words are learned using the distributed Skip-gram or Continuous Bag-of-Words (CBOW) models recently proposed by Mikolov. 
These models learn word representations using a neural network architecture that predicts the neighbors of a word.
We embedd  a large text corpus in the target language into a vector space using either the cbow or skipgram neural network. 
This embedding gives us two methods that we can use for improving bleu scores. 
We can measure the distance between word vectors. 
We can generate a list of the closest word vectors to a given word vector. 
We will explain how we use these methods in the next section.
