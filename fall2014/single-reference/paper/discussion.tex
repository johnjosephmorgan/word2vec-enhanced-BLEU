Bleu is a precision metric. 
Consider the following candidate/reference pair:
the the the the the the the 
the cat on the mat
We call this the  the overgeneration problem (the two the tokens are not a typo)
We handle this problem by removing a the in the reference each time it is matched . 
This takes care of the the overgeneration problem in the standard bleu metric. 
The the overgeneration problem remains in our method. 
Consider the candidate reference pair:
The price for the weapon I learned there
I found out the price of the weapon only there
The word ``for'' does not appear in the reference. 
Our method obtains similarity scores between ``for'' and each word in the reference that has not been mathced yet. 
Unfortunately, the word with highest similarity to ``for'' is ``there. 
``there" is chosen as the match for ``for'' and is removed from the referenced word list. 
When we later try to find a match for ``there'' an exact match is not made. 
In this case the standard BLEU metric assigns a higher score to the candidate than our method.
