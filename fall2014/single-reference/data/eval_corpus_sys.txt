A Republican strategy to counter the Obama re-election
The leaders of the Republicans to justify their policy with the need to combat election fraud.
However, the Brennan center the latter as a myth, and confirm that the electoral fraud is rare in the United States as the number of people killed by lightning strike.
The lawyers of the Republicans have in 10 years in the United States, moreover, only 300 cases of electoral fraud.
One thing is for sure: these new provisions will have a negative impact on voter turnout.
In this sense, these measures undermine part of the democratic system in the United States.
Unlike Canada, the United States responsible for the conduct of the elections in the various member states.
In this sense, the majority of American governments announced new laws since 2009, the procedures for the registration or ballot.
This phenomenon has grown in importance after the elections in November 2010, in which 675 seen new Republican representatives in 26 states.
As a result, 180 Bills introduced in 2011 alone, which limit the exercise of the right to vote in 41 states.
The new election laws require that voters present a photograph ID and proof of US citizenship.
Moreover, these laws also shortened the time frames for the early vote, declared the right to register as voters on election day, and citizens are denied the right to vote, for which a court acts.
before the 2006 elections has no US-state of the electorate, a photograph card show.
INDIANA was the first federal state, has made such a request.
The Supreme Court of the United States confirmed the constitutionality of the law in Indiana in 2008.
The Republican authorities rushed this practice extended to other states.
Over the last two years, they promoted bills in 34 states, where voters are forced into a photograph card show.
It is important to note that the US citizens, in contrast to Quebec does not have a universal identity card such as the health insurance card.
In fact, 11% of the citizens of the United States, say that 21 million voters who do not photograph card issued by a government authority of their state.
In addition, five million new voters in 2012 do not have such a card.
However, are often more than a hundred dollars to obtain the necessary card to pay.
The new restrictions are disproportionately affects young people, minorities and people with low incomes.
In fact, 25% of African-Americans, 15% of people with an income of less than $35,000, 18% of people over 65 and 20% of voters between 18 and 29 years of age do not have the necessary light picture card.
This goes further.
The students, are seen as voters, their vote more for Democratic candidates in several states, it is not allowed to use their photograph card issued by its establishment.
On the other hand, allow the same States members of Angel- or hunting clubs, choose the more on the Republican side, to use the cards issued by these clubs for elections.
In 2004, a federal state in which to choose a proof of citizenship.
Arizona was the first state to make such a request.
since 2011, a dozen states have laws adopted by the voters demand that they prove their US citizenship.
These measures are clearly aimed to limit the Hispanic vote.
It is obvious that two of three Hispanic voters to the Democratic Party.
In addition, Republican legislators in eight states laws in 2011, which was abolished the registration of voters on election day.
In addition, they have restricted the right of individuals and groups, to help those voters who want to register.
These restrictions are not without consequences.
For example, the campaigns have contributed to voter registration for the general elections in 2004, approximately 10 million citizens to register.
The measures adopted since 2009, the proportion of the registration of new voters in 2010 decreased by 17% compared to 2006.
In addition, Republican legislators in five other states have adopted laws, which aim to shorten the period for the early vote.
For example, in the general elections in 2008 were 33% of the electorate in Florida, have chosen in advance, African-Americans, even though they account for only 13% of the voters of the state.
The same applies to the Hispanic population.
The latter was only 11% of the electorate, but 24% of citizens have chosen in advance.
In contrast, the white, 76% of the voters, only 46% of the electorate, in advance.
of course, Democratic lawmakers and their supporters have strongly opposed the adoption of laws, which restrict the registration of voters.
Several Bills have been blocked by the veto, the democratic governors.
The advocate-General of the United States has intervened to suspend the controversial laws.
They were able to limit some of the damage.
For example, only 16 of the 34 states have passed laws that require the displayed a photograph card.
However, the new rules introduced in 2012 will no doubt complicate the exercise of the right to vote.
The Democratic critics denounce the party political nature of the adopted laws and see them as a clear aim to influence the outcome in key states for 2012.
A report of the Brennan centre of 2011 shows that those states that have adopted laws, 171 men represent the 270 votes in the electoral body are needed in order to win the presidency.
It is too early to confirm with certainty that these legislative changes to the electoral system will have significant impact on the outcome of the presidential election in 2012.
But one thing is certain: these new provisions will have a negative impact on voter turnout.
In this sense, these measures undermine part of the democratic system in the United States.
Prostate cancer screening: the test should be made or not?
The PSA test, in fact, sometimes flawed results with false negative or false positive results that lead to unnecessary medical interventions.
This leads to more hesitation is already helping men for the implementation of screening tests.
The test should be made or not?
We have sought the opinion of two doctors.
The studies conducted in the United States, many confounding factors between the control groups, so it is difficult to interpret this data and clear recommendations.
Another study, this time from Europe, came to the conclusion that there is a difference in the mortality of patients with and without early detection.
This study has also shown that the likelihood of education in an observation after 12 years of metastases is between 30% and 40% higher if no screening was carried out.
I therefore recommend the test from the age of 50 years, or 40 years if a direct relatives, was already ill with prostate cancer.
There is also a higher risk in men Afro-American origin.
The most important thing is to make the right decision, as soon as a cancer diagnosed.
There are cancers that are aggressive and indolent.
The patients must be made to understand the extent of the risk of cancer, the possible options which prostate crabs can remain untouched if it does not affect the quality of life in the long term, and in these cases tend to opt for an active monitoring of the disease.
Today, many of the men, where cancer has seen no treatment, because their cancer is aggressive and poses no threat to their lives.
It proposes you a active surveillance and offers them in advance of the disease treatment.
With increasing accuracy determines the criteria for deciding who should be dealt with and who not.
Nevertheless, I therefore recommend the implementation of the tests.
But the most important thing is to talk to his doctor to determine whether or not it should be carried out.
In cooperation with the international society for Urologie, Movember has developed an instrument with which it is possible to evaluate the pros and cons of the PSA tests.

prevention of the disease
Unfortunately, there is no magic bullet for the prevention of cancer.
Despite the progress made in the research is the adoption of a healthy way of life is the best way to reduce the risk of developing it.
It is estimated that 30% of cancers could be prevented if everyone would eat well and move enough.
"If there were no more smokers, this value would rise at least 50%," said André Beaulieu, spokesman for the Canadian cancer society.
However, it is expected that approximately 10% of cancers are caused by inheritance.
Several remain unresolved.
for the Canadian Cancer Society, the fight against tobacco addiction remains a priority, despite the drop in the number of smokers.
Smoking is responsible for 85% of cases of lung cancer.
There is also a risk factor for several other types of cancer.
It damages the health of the people.
"Today there are still 1.5 million smokers in Quebec," regrets the spokesman André Beaulieu.
encouraging data: Ten years after the elimination of the cigarette, the risk of dying of cancer by half.
The weight
According to the Canadian Cancer Society overweight and obesity also the outbreak of disease.
It seems the risk for breast cancer, Grimmdarm- Mastdarm- to increase SpeiseröHren- BauchspeicheldrüSen- and cervical cancer.
"The research shows that regular physical activity protects against colorectal cancer, fairy tale" throughout the lives, he added.
The food
The organisation also recommends to limit the consumption of red meat.
in large quantities, it increases the risk of developing a Grimm- or rectum.
sausages should also be avoided.
The preservation of meat by smoking, drying or salts can lead to the formation of carcinogens.
"The latter can damage cells and lead to the development of cancer," he says.
Vitamins
In recent years, several scientists have studied the link between cancer and vitamin supplements.
its investigations but are not conclusive.
The Canadian cancer society studies on vitamin E are contradictory.
While the study found by the reduction in the risk of prostate cancer, showed another rather an increase.
The effect of vitamin D to cancer was not yet clear.
Furthermore, Mr Beaulieu, stresses how important it is, with his doctor about his concerns and his family to speak to burden.
"The implementation of an early detection test does not lead to cancer."
The Higgs-Boson analysed
The announcement of the likely discovery of the Higgs Bosons has a certain sensation last summer, and for good reason.
In fact, we believe that this Boson is involved in nothing less than the mechanism, which is responsible for the mass of all the objects in the universe.
and it is the last particle whose existence of the standard model, our best or 'least wrong' explanation of nature and behaviour of the matter, predicted, but has not yet been observed empirically.
for physicists, however, it is still not completely sure that it really is the Higgs.
We know without a shadow of a doubt, that we have a real new particles, and that the predicted by the standard model Higgs-Boson much resembles.
In addition, this appears to be confirmed by new data this week have been presented at a major physics Congress in Kyoto, but there are still no data in order to be completely safe.
But we assume that it is indeed the Higgs, because apparently there is only a low risk to deceive, and we look at what it is.
In this world, there is a crucial law, which means that two objects cannot be at the same place at the same time.
It is not possible to violate this rule-and try not to, because they will hurt.
Even if the particle physics is a really strange world, it turns out that for such a law, they also applies: the Pauli exclusion principle established, the states that two particles cannot occupy the same space at the same time, if they are in the same "quantum state" and the "State" by and large, consists of some of its properties.
On this basis, the physicists share the particles in two categories.
In one corner are good citizens, are referred to as the Fermi one and just obey the principle of Pauli.
and in the other the Bosonen, a nasty bunch of anarchists, where nothing is sacred, in any case, not this principle, which means that they can find themselves in the same place at the same time.
These Bosonen links, according to the website the particle adventure of the Berkeley lab (which, incidentally, is absolutely astonishing) into two groups: the Mesonen, we will not deal with, and "force particles", by which the great forces of nature and with which the Higgs-Boson somehow would be used.
Here, it must be emphasised, however, that not all these Bosonen exotic creatures, such as one might think.
If you are able to read this story, then it is only thanks to a Bosons by exceptional banality: the Photon, or "light particles, the" messenger "of the electromagnetic force.
If a particle with an electrical load will be speeded up or change the direction, "disrupted" the electromagnetic field in this place, as a pebble in a pond was thrown out.
This "disturbance" creates an electromagnetic wave (light, infrared or ultraviolet radiation, etc.), and this wave is nothing more than a photon and therefore one of the Bosonen "sources of power."
more stable field
The same applies to the Higgs-Boson, with the difference that a different field, "disrupted" the Higgs field, must be, so that this Boson.
But the Higgs field is much more stable than the electromagnetic field; the virus needs to achieve a very high energies, a bit like a frozen pond, whose surface only by a very large rock Zerfurcht.
A huge particle accelerator as CERN is therefore needed-the large hadron collider is a ring with a volume of 27 km, in order to achieve such energy.
Once again, the analogy with the electromagnetic field is helpful in order to explain the relationship between the Higgs and the mass.
There are, in fact, not all particles and not all materials interact with the electromagnetic field.
Some, like magnets, do this, but others do not, for example, a piece of paper would never think of themselves on the fridge.
and equally not all particles interact with the Higgs field: those who do have a mass, while the other (as is the photon) do not have mass.
for what all this research can now "be good," Mrs Plamondon asks?
for the Science they serve the review of the standard model (SM), and they also allow physicists all deviations between the observations and to look closely at the predictions of the SM.
There are, in fact, many physicists eagerly hope that such derogations to be found, as the slightest difference open a door to a "new physics" and could fill some of the holes in the model.
We must say that the latter is still major shortcomings, because there is no explanation for the gravity (UPS) and the dark matter provides around 80% of the matter of the universe (again ups!).
However, the CERN such derogations which, until now, has not been found.
impact
The impact of this research for the general population are difficult to predict, but it would be wrong to assume that there is no.
In fact, in the early 1960s, the pioneers of lasers in the bell laboratories did not suspect that their work would trigger such a revolution.
They saw scientific applications, but nothing else.
In fact, the late physicist Willard Boyle, who has worked in the Bell Labs, in which the laser was invented in the 1960s, and the 1962 itself has developed the first permanent line were the first laser (Gepulst)-said that the laser at the beginning was seen more as a "gimmick" laboratory.
imagine...
In addition, applications can also surrounded from all the instruments, the research.
Willard Boyle again during his work in the optics in 1969, for example, has developed a small light sensor.
Although it was not the original purpose, this sensor all digital cameras in the world today serves as "an eye and has brought him the Nobel Prize for Physics in 2009.
Of course, this does not mean that the activities of the Lhc will change our lives, but it means that you really never know...
palliative care, and the best way to die... | le devoir
with your committee to "die with dignity" Quebec has recently discussed the sensitive issue of the life end.
The debate needs to be resumed in the near future, although a Bill is being prepared.
However, in this important area, much remains to be done.
le devoir has tried to look into this.
A few weeks ago, Mr l. still lived alone in his apartment in the MontéRéGie.
The prostate cancer, Aufzehrte, had left him a period of two years.
"They gave me five years to live, I have managed seven years," he said half-hearted in his bed in the home for palliative care, Victor-Gadbois in beloeil, in which he reached the previous day.
"However, it is always a shock to one cannot be prepared," he says.
The disease is doing its work: a huge weakness prevents him from, only to go to the toilet and even to eat.
table a delicious lunch, do help he resigned, to eat.
He even manages to smile bravely and to speak with strangers, which employs around him, his medicines, and offer him a bath.
the courage of ordinary death.
"My greatest wish is that my diarrhea heals, since this is humiliating," he shares.
A few hours later, the team has found a cure for this disease.
"In the course of our lives, we learn that a man in Pinkelt ', told Pierre Victor-Gadbois Brodeur, a psychologist in homes.
In return the childhood phase is an unacceptable humiliation for certain people.
"It depends on the person's ability" to take a step backwards, he notes.
According to several people who work in the palliative care, big events in the midst of this backward steps take place.
The patients in the home for palliative care Victor-trained Gadbois, all suffer from cancer.
They have a maximum life expectancy of three months.
At this stage, the doctors and nurses to look after them, no longer with so-called "curative care."
For example, 89 years, the worst fear, "aware and dying of suffocation".
But I really got to know my children from the disease.
"I have good children," she adds.
"I have no more hope in life," she says, before they accepted that a mask on, helps her breathe.
They are expected in the next few days still a last visit their son, comes from Italy.
homes Victor-Gadbois provides you with a group of voluntary body care and assistance in the food.
The palliative care will be used if there are no other options.
to make the die comfortable.
In Quebec, a bed on state residents for palliative care.
This is very little, if one takes into account that one day we will all die.
continued here will live under the best possible conditions, said Dr Christiane Martel, one of the doctors of the homes.
both at the level of physical, emotional or spiritual comfort.
it granted the dying wish of a mouth care with brandy or Pepsi.
the diabetics must no longer control their blood sugar levels.
and death is part of everyday life.
Yesterday evening, we have X a beer is served, who died in the course of the night.
This morning, his son from drinking the beer at the feet of the deceased.
"We help families and patients alike," reported care Director Nathalie Savard.
homes Victor Gadbois is no day-as the other.
In addition to an old man of 93 years, the last family meeting in court and well supported by his pillow, while its official opening, a young man dies of his parents, his wife of 36 years, which is surrounded and his two small children, tragically, after he has tried everything in order to survive.
"for six months, three to five beds are always subject to cancer patients in less than 45 years of age", Dr Christiane shares Martel worries.
53% of the home Victor Gadbois hospitalised patients come from their residential site, 47% come from the hospital.
problem of access to palliative care
It is said that 77% of Canadians have no access to palliative care, in other words a care to alleviate the suffering of patients if they have reached the final stage of their lives, both at home, in the hospital or in a nursing home.
and several organisations, such as the victor-Gadbois and the Society for domestic palliative care in the Montreal specialize more or less exclusively on the care of cancer patients.
This is the great flaw in the health care of Quebec ensures that several in the palliative care specialist doctors rule for the adoption of a law on euthanasia and Assistiertem suicide with concerns.
For the month of October is a manifesto in the circulation of prominent figures in the palliative care as Dr Balfour Mount and Dr Bernard Lapointe signed in order to express their opposition to such an initiative.
Dr Christiane Martel, the health system of Quebec is not strong enough to ensure that all have the right to a high-quality palliative care before it is accepted, move on to euthanasia.
Recently, she says, I saw a patient who was 14 days with great pain in the emergency room without that it has taken measures to alleviate.
I am afraid that the only reason why the patients want to die because they do not receive adequate health care.
At the same time, several oncologists treat their patients despite the worst predictions stubbornly until the last day.
The chances of survival of HéLèNe Richard were already minimal when it broke off a difficult chemotherapy.
As I Onko login has been told that I will stop the treatment, they replied that they regret that I told the fight, please.
However, she had told me that I was in the end.
No Omni strong care
Dr. Martel believes that 90% of the patients, who have asked to die, to thank the staff, that it has not granted this wish, after their pain was eased by a team of palliative care.
But it must be made clear that the palliative care of the pain treatment is not omnipotent.
Elsie Monereau, head of the palliative care society the domestic palliative care to the greater MONTREAL 8% of patients not on the treatment of pain.
at the very end of life so the doctors often resort to the Terminale Sedierung, which amounts to the patients either sporadic or permanently by the time of his death EinzuschläFern.
We can no longer pretend that we do not accept this side of the suffering.
patients without pain relief will increasingly have the opportunity on this Terminale Sedierung.
patients whose pain is not be relieved, all say the same sentence: "I want to die."
But that does not necessarily mean 'I want that me neutered, "but" I would like that my pain. "
The implementation of this report was possible due to a journalism scholarship Canadian Health Research Institute.
large-scale real estate scandals in Quebec
Officials of the Road office, companies in the construction of the main political parties, fundraisers and specialists of the Italian mafia tell every day what they know about a great "system" in the construction industry, officials, politicians, trade unionists and mafioso are enmeshed.
A "industry", which was very expensive for the taxpayer of Quebec, particularly in the 1990s and 2000s.
"It is strange how the system is, since it has taken drastic measures," wit tent Jacques Duchesneau, MEP and former head of the Montreal police in Quebec.
The scandal by him as a result of a thorough investigation into the embezzlement was uncovered in the context of the treaties on road construction in Quebec, the former Prime Minister had only reluctantly agreed.
The "Duchesneau report" established a direct link between the industry, the secret financing of parties and bribery of officials.
"Since the beginning of the investigation in 2010," he stresses, "the department alone would save a billion dollars to the treaties", because some ZüGelten your instinct, in order to receive their share.
The Charbonneau Commission "has already brought two mayors', he added, in the hope that it will succeed," the tactics behind the individuals. "
A 2011 launched permanent anti-corruption unit
The 2011 launched permanent anti-corruption unit to accountants, identify with their troops and analysts of the Government also great efforts.
In addition, the Police "Marteau-force", which since 2009 has meant that the "sewage cartel" by Montreal in the artificial inflation of the treaties more...
In the last few weeks, it has made series of raids and allegations of fraud and corruption against local officials such as Frank Tam Pino and Richard Marc Otte, the mayor of a suburb.
The next on the list would be Gilles Vaillancourt, just from his post as mayor of laval, Quebec, the third largest city resigned.
He is suspected to have repeatedly received bribes in exchange for public contracts.
Montreal engineers of road construction official, have been charged and entrepreneurs of Italian origin, as Tony Accurso and Lino Zambito.
The latter has sensation by providing the Commission with the functioning of the "system" for the preservation of public contracts.
He has received several years in Montreal 3% of the value of the contracts paid a broker associated with the Mafia, transferred the money to the Union Montreal party of mayor GéRald Tremblay.
Mr Zambito has had his hand in the game throughout the 2000s, by more than 88 Canadian dollars (province of around EUR 68) parties, especially an liberals in power at the time.
He also acknowledged an illegal fund-raising for the former Liberal Vice-President Nathalie Normandeau.
sewers have been artificially inflated contracts, the costs of him
In Montreal, the "system" of corruption worked smoothly.
The former construction engineer Gilles Surprenant, described in detail the Commission: in ten years ago he received gifts from companies, invitations to play ice hockey, golf tournaments, restaurants and travel, as well as $736.000 bribes in return for sanitation contracts, which cost it artificially.
other officials of the road construction office they have admitted that they would smear by 30-40% of the Bills with false supplementary services artificially AufbläHten.
The organisers of the party has also accused the mayor, Martin Dumont, Mr Tremblay, that he has deliberately overlooked on a shadow budget, its coffers filled with black money.
Following the revelations, Mr Tremblay resigned in early November, which Montreal plunged into a serious crisis.
Chantal Rouleau was one of the first members of Montreal, the alarm.
as mayor of the city district RivièRe-des-prairies, in the east of the island, they are rejected in 2010 against the sale of a community land that bought for $5 million and was sold for 1.6 million in construction in the booming real estate market.
70% of black money in election campaigns
The investigation will be carried out, in the end, she says, that "a thread that will enable us to understand, suspected by ants in the functioning of the system in order to stop the evil and to denounce the perpetrators."
It says that the procedure was "painful, but positive."
We are going to need to cleanse the wound, but only for Montreal certain investigation unit and supervision to prevent a return of the questionable practices.
How to clean power.
on a regular basis.
Jacques Duchesneau, for its part, notes that "officials have stolen from several hundred million dollars", but, above all, concerned about the role of the 'agent, aware of the tactics, "if they were not involved in the fraud.
On the basis of a 70% share of black money in the financing of election campaigns in Quebec wit tent: "I was told that this was only a weak simulacrum of reality."
The Quebec government is proposing to limit donations to parties at $100, which, according to him, would do nothing to change the situation: "As long as the campaign expenditure will not be strictly limited, black money circulating in the policy."
He recommends a complete overhaul of the system for awarding public contracts and the funding of parties: "we can not deeper; with courage to the bottom of things by the House on a more solid basis, we can rebuild with more controls and laws."
If this history is the international reputation of Montreal, Quebec and that calls for Mr Duchesneau those laugh, take a look in their own backyard...
"PSG is not the FC Barcelona!"
In this season, with PSG, you have taken on a new dimension.
How do you explain this progress?
it from a personal point of view, but also can be explained by the new dimension of the PSG.
great players arrived.
Every day I am on your side.
The technical staff has given me too much.
These elements spur me to improve my play every day.
and in a game, this is easier.
In football everything very quickly.
But I must stop not enthusiasm.
Since my early days in the centre of the preparatory training of INF Claire Fontaine to my game time in Saint-Etienne, I have always made gradual progress.
They are thus the competition advantage introduced by Carlo Ancelotti...
The newcomers are accustomed to this summer's Games very high levels.
They also know that any training unit is crucial.
This means that a player as I stand up to, and wants to give his best.
It gives me Carlo Ancelotti position much in terms of my game.
He is supported by co-coaches such as Claude Makelele, who played in the same position as me.
Ancelotti is the right person for the job?
of course.
Ancelotti instills all technicians respect.
At present, there is no comparable in the Ligue 1 person and he is one of the best coaches in Europe.
He has a rich experience and has won many titles with prestigious clubs.
He had contact with great players.
I think that he will win another title in Paris.
In January, I had an encouraging conversation with him.
I had just recovered from an injury series.
The trust he has placed in me is also an explanation for my services.
What do you think about the first part of the season of the PSG?
In the Ligue 1, Lyon took the place of Spitzenreiters.
But we lurk in the ambush.
The Champions League is one of our most important objectives: We have qualified for the eighth final in this way.
What is the objective of the Association in this competition?
We will try to get as far as possible.
From now on, everything is possible.
However, we have very good European teams say.
First of all, we want the first of our group Porto, so that we can fight the return leg of the eighth finales than home game.
Can the PSG in the short term, a major European club?
He has said the budget...
In order to be a great European club must win Paris title and make a name in the long term.
This is not the case today.
Financially, the PSG the resources so that the project taking shape.
It would be a great failure, not to win the title in the Ligue 1, as was the case in the last season?
of course, this would be a great disappointment.
This year, it is really close to my heart, this title cream off.
In the last season we were close.
In May, we were disappointed because we were strong enough for the victory.
We have finished the season with a very strong performance.
We have concluded with 79 points.
should normally be master with 79 points...
But another team, those of Montpellier, has achieved an even better season.
I believe that this year is the right thing to do.
Even if the big teams such as Marseille, Lyon or Bordeaux in title fight, I believe that we have the stuff to win.
Do you think that the media expect too much from the PSG?
In the light of what has been invested and the players we have, it is normal that a lot is expected of us.
We fully accept that.
However, if we win with a home game against Troyes 4-0, and you can still find something, what you accuse us, something is certainly frustrating.
One wonders what people expect.
We could never win every weekend with 4-0.
We are not of the FC Barcelona.
We are trying to set up a game concept.
Building a team with the time.
in the Champions League we have shown strength.
If you look at Manchester City, a club for two seasons fails to qualify for the eighth final, and also has a huge expenditure.
In terms of the sums invested believed one lead you to time out with 15 points.
This would mean that our opponents and ignored the French Cup.
Lyon and Marseille in the last season were not good, this new PSG "Geboostet."
This shows that the Ligue 1 is exciting.
I hope that we will be in the month of May, the smiling winner and tell us that, despite all the difficulties, we have finally won.
The PSG seems completely have to be dependent on the performance of Zlatan Ibrahimovic.
so much the better, that speaks of a "Zlatan Ibrahimovic dependence".
In other words, that have strong and firing many goals.
that is why he came, and he proves that he is the star of the Ligue 1.
wherever he has played, he has eyes that he is a great player and a world star.
within the team, we respect both the player and the person.
it also respects the people who surrounded him.
What he has done is really extraordinary.
This encourages others to improve their play.
Thiago Silva, one of the best defenders in the world, allows all other also to make progress.
How have you seen the Euro 2012 with the French national team?
as a disappointment.
It was very important to me to participate in this championships.
Unfortunately, my injury has prevented from having some game time.
I saw things there, from which I am stronger.
Today, I am unable to achieve good games in the national team.
This was the "Bleus" my hope for my baptism.
What has happened in Ukraine, we have learned our lesson, and today we have an exemplary behaviour.
what you think of the first few months of Didier Deschamps, head of the "Bleus"?
He has achieved promising results.
We have a good position in the qualifying group for the World Cup.
The national coach is strict, is close to the players and to the victory.
As Laurent Blanc.
But I have no comparison.
Blanc had achieved its aim, had qualified for the European Championships.
I hope that Didier Deschamps will lead the "Bleus" after Brazil.
On 16 October in Spain is forced undecided (1: 1) a start game?
This game has given us confidence.
Everyone has used for all the others.
before the meeting in Spain, I have never seen a similar game in my career.
Bitcoin is possible without bank pay and sell
the opposite of the current monetary exchange on the basis of central banks, identified transactions and administrative fees between the parties involved.
Moreover, as is so often the case in these technologies is a political vision by bank monopolies was palpable: the belief that the current monetary system, leading to financial crises.
In fact, Satoshi Nakamoto (a pseudonym) invented a virtual currency Bitcoin both (convertible into dollars, euros, etc) as well as a protocol for the secure exchange of such as BitTorrent, which allows the direct exchange of files.

In June 2011, after the course of Bitcoin had reached a peak of $30 (23 euros) to $2, he fell five months later today, before it recovered to around $10 (the courses are listed on the website Bitcoincharts.Com).
nothing particularly impressive in comparison with the real world trade currencies or financial products.
However, the European Central Bank (ECB) in a report published in October on virtual currencies interest shown.
It describes Bitcoin virtual currency as "the greatest success," "in competition with the dollar or the euro," and "similar to the traditional currencies."
Bitcoin differs from other types of virtual currencies such as the "credits" that are used to make progress in a video game, you play by winning or buy (and sometimes can also exchange).
The social network Facebook has also developed a system of this kind.
However, trade is controlled by a Central Authority each time and processed.
At the same time, with Bitcoin all network nodes, auditors, trustee of the paper money-issuers and buyers and sellers.
How does this network?
In reality, any transaction between two users will take place between two e-mail addresses in the form of an e-mail.
with the difference that the user can choose a different address for each payment, ensuring the anonymity.
A series of associated with this transaction data electronically through a double encryption system will be signed.
In this way, the network can verify the authenticity of the transaction.
With the help of the content of the file, it is also possible to ensure that the traded Bitcoins account book in the whole network of public accounts are available.
The crucial step is to register this new transaction in the book.
This is done through a mathematical task on the computers will be launched, with the winners of a kind of preliminary central banker, has the privilege to add this additional line.
It is a fragment of the file, the conversion of a large file in a shorter and clear electronic fingerprint.
The computer "," the new transaction and do a number, before the whole "Zerhackt."
The aim is to find that number, a special fingerprint (many Noughts at the beginning).
If this figure has been found, the other nodes can easily check whether it is the right one.
The transaction is permanently linked with the chain of all other transactions and any modification would change the fingerprint.
If a user to cheat two time very fast (less than 10 minutes) with the same money would want to pay, only one of the two transactions will be validated by the network and the other remains, without a link, because both have different fingerprints.
The computer, the task has 50 Bitcoins.
In order to prevent a halved inflation this reward will regularly, probably before the end of 2012.
Thus, Bitcoins in circulation are limited to 21 million, but up to a hundred million Tel divisible, what a certain room...
Moreover, increased the difficulty of the task, with any improvement in computing power.
The life of the network has had ups and downs.
The sites provide services for Bitcoin, have been attacked and stolen the Bitcoin-deposits.
"The weakness is not the actual minutes used", Pierre Noizat, has just introduced Paymium assures us that a company is to pay with real money and uses the Bitcoin network.
The ECB also reports on the possibility of money laundering through this anonymous service.
However, cash also contains these shortcomings.
major players, such as Wikipedia refuse donations.
others such as the blog platform Wordpress will accept them.
Recently, Adi Shamir and Dorit Ron analysed by the Weizmann Institute in Israel the account book and showed that almost 80% of Bitcoins in circulation.
Launched in November was a "mega-selling '.
"Thirty thousand dollars have been exchanged," glad Jon Holmquist, the gold coin Abul working for the company, Bitcoins converted.
Pierre Noizat, is also the author of a paper on this currency, firmly believes in the potential of this technology as transaction network.
his system Paytunia a credit card (with real money) or use a contactless payment with a mobile phone, but Bitcoin for the validation of the transactions, which are cheaper.
In addition, managed the holders of its identity and can, therefore, remain anonymous.
The system, the traders can easily be implemented, and the latter have no new terminals or install computer programs.
They simply need to specify an address from a phone can be "identified and photographed," Pierre Noizat, assured that he has thousands of users.
It is a general trend in the hierarchical systems designed for more horizontal systems to be reconsidered.
"It will take some time until Bitcoin, but 2013 could be a turning point," he predicted.
Moreover, the ECB, in its report, the various as highly respected risks in case of success today to reassess this currency.
We are withdrawn from Afghanistan.
and then?
French troops have left their responsibility in Afghanistan (Kapisa and Surobi).
NATO and the United States should follow suit by the end of 2014.
It is time that the Afghan army to take ownership of their territory again, and that the Afghan people will decide their future, without all of us expect.
In particular, we have Afghan farmers punished, as we have seen them as terrorists.
and even with our soldiers, and injured 88 killed and mutilated.
The Taliban are from foreign extremists, former leaders, who have fled to Pakistan, but also often refuse from farmers, an armed foreign presence, such as the time of the Soviets.
They want to defend their centuries-old and archaic traditions, even if you jihadists, Pakistanis, Arabs, Uzbeks and Tajiks have joined.
tolerated, sometimes supported by the local insurgents, the latter will not be here if the Western countries will be discreet.
The withdrawal of French troops from the base in Nijrab, I observed from a with almond trees orchard hills, was financed with the help of French loans, properly.
The helicopters üBerflogenen lorry and tanks-convoys have reached Kabul, without being attacked.
By the end of 2014 there will be no longer receive the Taliban in Kabul.
Since their irresistible rise from 1994 to 1996, the conditions have changed.
Kabul was empty and the country due to the struggles of the various inflammatory groups from war.
their power was seen as a kind of liberation and return to safety.
Afghan women have for the obscurantism of the price paid by the Al-Qaeda organisation overthrew farmers, but their situation has not yet improved.
former mujahedeen, the Afghan government and current Taliban have a common desire to keep women in a position of inferiority.
The main figures of the anti-Soviet war came back to power in 2001.
They have transformed into traders by land the government confiscated for the construction of refugees from Iran and Pakistan to sell and so benefit from the massive American of subcontracting.
They have brought into disrepute, and most of them were not even involved in the fighting.
As I have heard it in the campaigns, people want a government that is not made up of thieves.
Many young people want to leave the country, as well as those who could take advantage of the American benefits: the flight is considerable.
Young people have tired of the war and its ideologies.
during their exile in Iran or Pakistan, you have had contact with the modern world, and have their advantages.
approximately 65% of the population is under 25 years; Kabul now has 5 million inhabitants, which is one-fifth of the population.
In the cities, state schools are full of boys and girls.
These young people, neither the obscurantism of former parties still want to return to the corruption of some leaders, will be jobs available.
All parties, including the armed, are obsessed with mobile phones; television with its Turkish series, looked at the modern world, is everywhere.
The army is now available.
will the authorities, under whose authority they will be regarded as legitimate?
former commanders of the anti-Soviet struggle in the province are already making efforts to restore the militias, which are beyond the power of the central government.
Afghanistan, the land of mountains with strong local identities would benefit from a degree of decentralisation in the example of the Western nations, but through the abolition of the Office of the Prime Minister, since the constitution of 1964, the United States wanted from him was a centralised state with a strong presidential violence.
President Karzai does not want foreign controls, especially on the occasion of the elections planned for April 2014.
However, since the 1950s and long before his country dependent on foreign aid.
industries have not been rebuilt, functioning congestion works are not there and major irrigation system have not been repaired.
everything is imported; apart from fruit and vegetables will produce nothing.
The private initiative is the priority.
in a country that has been devastated by 30 years of war, a state control of infrastructure would be required.
The rumour spread that Afghanistan was immense wealth.
This reinforces the impression that the Western countries were only on the ground, in order to grasp.
without energy, iron and copper ore processing, or without transport on the ground for a possible export on the mountains is no mining.
The Chinese have the run of MES aynak is already almost left, the international archaeologists (funded by the World Bank) on the vast Buddhist site to make their digs and remain the most important employer in the province.
One day, it will also be necessary that Afghanistan and Pakistan, which are largely dependent on imports and exports, restore normal relations.
The withdrawal of French combat troops was completed on 20 November.
The new cooperation agreement provides for the continuation of traditional aid: girls and boys high schools, Institute for French universities, French Institute, military, legal, medical and agricultural cooperation, support the archaeological delegation.
since 2009, has a service "civil-military operations," the Ministry of Defence (CIMIC) has been stopped, the 2012 in dozens of mountain villages carried out numerous charitable work and measures for the rehabilitation of agriculture and by a small French non-governmental organisation, in order to try to win the "hearts and minds" and to achieve the impossible task of aid and offensive actions.
This work, for the many local workers were needed, can help to suppress the uprising: irrigation, drinking water wells, reforestation, fruit trees, soil protection and increase agricultural land.
What souvenir back after two billion military spending?
A much more modest budget will help to improve local living conditions in these often amounting to a total of more than 2,000 metres the valleys are very hard.
In the message, dozens of small agricultural projects to written questions of communities in the province of Kapisa.
for the farmers of the uprising led by foreign groups, which, according to its own what their desire is the continuation of low, well-controlled and they directly affect the civilian aid in their favor.
A constitution with the crowbar in Egypt
It is a new game of poker from President Mohammed Mursi.
While Egypt in terms of the constitutional declaration, it temporarily, more divided than ever, given the unlimited power he has decided to put everything on a card.
To the surprise of all, the next day he announced on Wednesday that the constituent assembly will adopt its final version.
Just a week ago, the head of this house an additional two months to complete its work.
Egypt now for almost two years, is based on a preliminary, repeatedly amended text weakens the institutional stability and leads to a legal mess.
This new initiative has only provided for a further division of the country.
for his opponents, the president remains in his "autocratic delirium", he continues, "breaking his word" and "the right underfoot."
On the part of his supporters can rest assured that there is a way to bring an end to the institutional and political crisis as quickly as possible, and to speed up the transition process.
A referendum should be held within 14 days.
a very short period, forcing the brothers on their projects, the Egyptians to explain the text section for section.
for the president, it is also a way to rediscover his public and democratic legitimacy, during the protest in the raging throughout the country.
In an interview with the American week after contrary perspective time Mohammed Mursi seems to be convinced that the Egyptians will vote favourably.
Given that the Egyptian people with this resort on a hasty vote an ultimatum: 'Is it for my draft or I will reserve the unlimited power ", the latter should be an end to the alleged after the adoption of the constitution.
85 largely Islamist members of the constituent assembly have adopted the text yesterday in a strange atmosphere.
The majority of the liberals is not complied with the request.
On the eve of the constitutional declaration they have averted in mid-November, because they believe that they are not in the situation, to assert their views.
Representatives of human rights organisations, religious minorities and civil society have acted similarly.
In order to achieve the quorum yesterday morning were members of 11 people in a rush, deputy added.
Some are very close to the Muslim brothers.
Generally, it is not surprising that the article were adopted unanimously.
Moreover, the commentators found it amusing that the only disagreement was expressed for the prayer of the day... in the time is, as some Members of the Board were of the opinion that the shuttle at the constituent assembly was not exactly.
The text, which was adopted yesterday evening, consists of 234 articles.
Article 2, all the attention has, finally, identical with that of the constitution of 1971, and states that "the principles of Sharia are the main source of law."
The Salafi Islamic parties for the establishment of Islamic law is an important requirement, the hope, "to replace the principles" by "the rules", which would have made it possible to have a stricter application.
for the Islamists is the fact that this article has not been changed, proof of its good will and respect for the other members of the Egyptian society.
"hypocrisy," say the Liberals, who see this only as a propaganda blow.
According to them, the Islamisation of the constitution on other articles.
They have, in particular, Article 220, the Al-Azhar University placed a consultative role, particularly in relation to the review of compliance with the laws of Sharia law.
According to the Egypt specialist Sophie Pommier, this is worrying, because "the people who are called upon to give an opinion, not elected and any democratic legitimacy.
you can see the first signs of a theocracy. "
The fears of the Liberals will also be fuelled by the fact that the next rector of this university will be far less moderate than the present.
"At present, no specific religious commitment.
With this constitution, we remain within the framework of the civil state.
most of the lawyers, who have worked on this text, are not Ulema, but academics, was trained in the French system, "soothed Alexis Blouet, writes a doctoral thesis on the Egyptian constitution transition.
However, he acknowledges that "there may be some ambiguity in relation to Article 220, because terms borrowed from the religious vocabulary.
It relates in particular to the "Fiqh '[Islamic law], Anm. that red.
and in the future could be raised the question of whether civil judges are competent to decide. "
in addition to its religious aspect is the text adopted yesterday strongly criticised because of the far-reaching powers granted to the President of the Republic.
The Muslim Brothers argue that they are significantly reduced compared with the former regime.
Another point of contention: the powers of the army.
in accordance with the wishes of the military review of the defence budget will not be presented to the parliament, but a National Defence Council.
There will also be a ban on civil procedure in military courts, as demanded by the associations for the defence of human rights.
The latter also share their concerns in relation to the text with the tradesmen, as freedom.
The offence of blasphemy, and insults are now banned, which could have serious consequences for the right to freedom of expression, in particular for the press.
In addition, no longer article refers to the protection of women, Heba Morayef of Human Rights Watch.
your opinion is the only positive point of the ban on torture by Article 36.
This word was not included in the previous constitution.
While the Egyptian president had to comment on television last night, demonstrations are planned for this afternoon.
The supporters of the head of state will be Saturday on marching.

"The great and powerful" leads to Moscow: migrants save money for language
While members and human rights activists to discuss the benefits of the law on compulsory language tests for migrants, criminal act already with counterfeit certificates
Every year 13 million guest workers to Moscow, St. Petersburg and other cities of Russia.
Most of them are the citizens of the Central Asia: Uzbekistan, Tajikistan and Turkmenistan.
their only aim is to remaining families to earn money for the maintenance of the home.
A law came into force on 1 December, according to which any working immigrant must take a test, the knowledge of the Russian language,.
So far, this Regulation applies only to migrants who want to work in the service sector, the local housing and retail.
However, should the tests with the time, according to the Federal Migration authority for all migrant workers on duty in the future.
We must not only in Russian history and language tests, but also tests the foundations of the legislation.
language, both for the preservation, as well as the extension of the work permit.
The only exceptions apply to citizens of countries where Russian is the official language.
People are also excluded from the scope of this law, the training certificates and diplomas received before the disintegration of the USSR in 1991.
The point, the problem and the protection of rights
The examination will be under the aegis of the Pushkin-Institute for the Russian language, the Russian People's Friendship University, Moscow State University, of the St. Petersburg State University and other Russian high schools.
The migrants can take the tests in all cities; similar centres in Russia more than 160 have already been opened.
The initiative for the introduction of the tests was supported by the members of the State Duma and the Federal Migration Service.
However, human rights activists said several times before the entry into force of the law in the press the following question: What does the whole?
The legislation, to produce what changes, both for the Russians and for guest workers?
In particular, say the migration authority spokesman, is concerned, to reduce the number of forced labour.
"Many are now talking about the protection of the rights of migrant workers," says the head of the Federal Migration Service Office in Tajikistan, Viktor Sebelew.
their rights must be protected but before their departure.
Only an organised recruitment will be 90% foreign workers to solve the problems.
encounter problems immigrants without work, education, language skills and medical observation.
Sebelew is convinced that a future migrants without language skills will inevitably meet people with evil intentions, which, under the pretext of aid it in a dark, close cabin, where he stay with dozens of his same months without food and documents and 12 to 14 hours a day toil.
We get many complaints from our migrants.
"In the home will have a promised and, upon arrival, they cheated, confiscated their passports and do not receive the promised pay ', the head of the main administration for migration of the Tajik migration authority, Tolib Schwaripow.
not shout, boss!
However, many citizens of the Central Asian republics in Russia not only want their money, that they do not speak the language of the country of destination, but also can hardly express in writing in their own language.
Of course, this is your fault, not so much as the evil: only a few of the Turkmen, Uzbeks and Tajiks can also only a sound basic education.
because in their families, there is not even money to feed the children, let alone to buy them a decent clothing, shoes and school matters.
As a teenager, these children will be the first opportunity to earn money immediately.
"It is difficult without language," they give.
"You FüHlst humiliated and degraded."
Human rights activists say the law following important aspect.
The test must only migrants with legal status.
They do not have this status, so there is no test and therefore no official work.
Meanwhile, the majority of the guest workers continue to illegally in Russia.
'warm welcome' or 'entry prohibited for unauthorised'
many migrants to confirm that it is not easy to obtain an official status in Russia.
The reason, of course, bureaucratic hurdles and the linguistic difficulties.
it also costs money: 12 to 16 thousand rubles.
A fake registration can be quickly and only for one and a half thousand.
Most of the staff of the Russian police know that our documents forged and we are not registered, and it then cases of blackmail.
"They want one or two hundred rubles for cigarettes and tea", the Tadschike Umed Huschkadamow against journalists.
"just to spare no expense for false papers'
On the day the law came into force, it turned out that not only the registration documents of the migrants may be falsified.
some counterfeit certificates, the completion of the language tests certify by staff of the Federal Migration Service have been hijacked.
The fraudulent documents were printed with a normal color printer.
of course, the new owners have received this not for nothing: every migrant, hoped to spare as the tests, paid for the document seven thousand rubles.
This is more than twice as much as the cost for the official test: This costs a migrant worker three thousand rubles.
The fact that the most important immediate task is to protect the system against corruption, it cannot simply be bought the certificates, both officials and human rights activists agree.
For the moment, the public authorities can guest workers who fall through the test for the first time, that it is time for a language course.
In addition, the new arrivals will be offered without knowledge in areas where no active communication with people is necessary.
Interior Ministry ignored illegal arms market
very low share of legal weapons to crimes
The Russian Ministry of the Interior is planning a tightening of the law for private weapons owners.
So the authorities respond to recent events: injured in shooting at weddings and seven deaths in the killing spree of the Moscow lawyer Dmitri Winogradow.
The police wants to ban the wearing of non-lethal weapons in public and the age for the possession of firearms from 18 to 21 years.
The proposal, the chairman of the Duma committee for security and the fight against corruption, Irina Jarowaja, and promised that the changes to the law will soon be submitted to the Duma.
not all are satisfied that the Russian authorities to combat the problems through "attraction of the screws".
The Internet was published an open letter, the author-representatives of various weapons associations-are calling on the authorities to refrain from "pointless tightening".
The percentage of registered crimes with weapons is very small, said the criminal law Wasilij Lesnikow, the BBC's Russian service.
According to the statistics of the Ministry of the Interior, 142 crime with application of the registered weapons in 2012, committed in the course of six months, while a total of 1,168 thousand offences were recorded for the same period.
The authors of the open letter are convinced that a tightening of the law for private gun owners will not deter criminals, on the black market.
At present, you can find every possible weapon in Moscow for little money, according to the authors.
Meanwhile, the Ministry of the Interior, stresses that the proliferation of illegal weapons under control.
suppliers: from the factories to the officers
The weapons on several channels on the black market.
there are five main channels, told a former Colonel Viktor Baranez, 10 years in the Ministry and the General Staff.
screenshot of a website, adopts the arms orders
The first channel is the army or the military, weapons were stolen during the fighting in the Caucasus.
"The weapons were both of the Russian officers and stealing the Kaukasiern itself," says Baranez.
On the second channel of illegal arms, the Guardians are stolen by criminals.
Baranez explained that this weapons count, both from the chambers of the police as well as directly from members of the law enforcement authorities have been stolen.
further sold illegal weapons from military arsenals.
Many military camps it often came to the explosions.
"There is evidence that, in some cases, it was arson, in order to cover up the lack of weapons," says the former military personnel.
Under Baranez, contribute to the black market weapons manufacturers.
"Today there are many private arms factories, the stand up to international competition and therefore the weapons dump under the hand on the black market in Moscow," reported the expert.
another channel of the black market is the smuggling.
many guns and guns come from poor countries such as Kyrgyzstan.
"Sometimes there is a separate, small-scale production and a mafia, organized the smuggling," explained the former military personnel.
Where are the weapons?
experts calculated what percentage of each of the five channels in the supply of the black market with illegal weapons around.
In 2011, a report was drawn up by the Center for problem analysis and state administration.
The experts analyzed reports of the Ministry of the Interior and of the Federal Service for state statistics, forensic literature and publicly available data on portals on weapons.
The vast majority of illegal weapons, according to investigators from the army and the legal authorities.
Half of the weapons on the black market are there through the fault of responsible in their work to do with weapons have reached ", it says in the report.
According to the data provided by the researchers, 14% 17% of the weapons come from conflict areas go back to thefts of weapons production, and 5% from illegal digs.
A sales adviser of an arms-laden, does not want to be named, assured that weapons will be found in illegal digs, long no one buys more, because they are obsolete.
According to him, it is more likely that dealers are getting supplies in a weapons cache.
a weapon, for example, a FäHnrich TT-type, bought a gun.
The weapon will be issued and the fence.
"The dealers the weapon in the city and they sold for EUR 900 per piece with two magazines," he tells
"The police know about everything and therefore leads, of course, if they fail to comply with the plan for the detection of crime, periodic monitoring purchases dealers, illegal weapons can offer," adds the sale advisers.
"As in the luxury shop '
buyers and sellers are the most well-known each other.
I had looked at websites and blogs, as someone who was closely on me and I suggested to the station "Begowaja", where a person would wait for me, I am in a certain place, where we could negotiate the price.
The price for the weapon I learned there
military commentator Viktor Baranez
"In order to acquiring a weapon, I need a well-known, the contacts", told the sale advisers. "I have such a well-known, but I do not trust him."
There are traders in the markets, but we must go there and with a code Verabreden as "Ivan Iwanowitsch, the target that the daughter had lost a tooth."
I am currently on a well-known, even to some blow rings I trust.
It also provides me the blow rings only because he knows that I am not the tune.
newcomers looking for weapons in various ways.
The former soldiers Viktor Baranez tried as buyers of illegal weapons in the mid-1990s, when he wrote an article on this issue.
The scheme, according to him, have not changed.
He got a photo album that was reflected in the 'everything possible'.
"I felt like the luxury shop," remembers the soldiers.
The buyer according to Baranez does not get a pig in a poke, but everything can try.
I buy a potential customer is not simply, but ride with the sellers in the forest, and we put up a target.
"I can shoot, and when I am convinced that the weapon has a good shot, we negotiate with each other," describes the expert.

Internet search engines show search results to Web sites and groups in "Vkontakte, where weapons" for various purposes ".
It does not need any papers there are personal.
"They need just the right amount of money," it says in the advertisement on the website "buy fight gun or rifle."
There users their orders and ask questions.

"of course, without a licence," asks users' Ivan '(I quote word for word).
"buy a TT. Moscow" is the Noncommitted question of "Fedorenkow."
The Federal Security Service did recently, countless false websites and buyers wanting to buy the weapons, the service or go into the net.

I have heard of the following Scheme: the website is registered abroad, and Russian laws are not normally applied.
The leaders are the orders.
The buyer transfers the money on a bank machine.
"In response, a photo and a description of the Verstecks weapon," reported the press spokesman for the non-profit organisation "Pravo na Oryzhie" Dmitri Kislow.
Viktor Baranez stressed that we can go to finish empty-handed and behind bars, if you have a question on a Web page.

A Makarow for $100
The purchase of illegal firearms, according to the experts, with prices from $100 to 900.
According to Dmitri Kislow of the organisation "Pravo na Oryzhie Makarow type 'a gun can buy for $100 to 300.
We must wait up to one and a half months.
The weapon will be spent in military arsenals of overseers middle-ranking.
According to the official statistics of the Ministry of the Interior, the number of offences with illegal arms in Russia in the period from January to October 2011 by 7% 22,9 thousand, while the number of uncovered cases of theft and extortion in connection with arms, ammunition, explosives and explosive shrank by 7.8%.
In the United States almost-Food- and supermarket workers go on strike
Every fourth American young people sitting behind the pay of Mc Donald 's
In the last few days there was everywhere in the United States to massive protests against low wages in branches of Wal Mart and restaurants popular fast-food chains such as Mc Donald's, Burger King, Taco Bell and Wendy's and Kentucky Fried Chicken.
Still, no one can predict whether the protests will further increase or the air soon.
The protests are supported by unions and several left-wing non-profit-making organisations.
in addition to the increase of modest salaries of simple Walmart- and fast-food workers, the organizers of the protests aim to set up trade unions.
So far, this sector of the economy are not unionized.
46 cents in a year?
The protests began last week after Thanksgiving, the so-called black Friday, the sales in the United States, the millions of customers Anlockten, which sometimes led to Handgemengen.
To this day, some Wal-Mart, with workers, of which there are 2.2 million worldwide, their work and Bestreikten branches of the chain, together with trade unions and left-wing activists, whose target people of low and middle-income.
Wal Mart, ranging from nappies on hunting guns and car batteries, all products sold to Staubsaugern, eggs and milk.
The goods in the Wal Mart branches is between 8% and 27% more on average than in large supermarkets.
Why buy many of the low-paid Wal Mart employees only on their own work.
the prices and the variety made Wal Mart to one of the largest companies in the United States.
According to critics, Wal Mart can sell the goods are often so favourable, because the workers are poorly paid.
The latter complaints about hard work conditions, for example the lack of forklift trucks or hand scanners.
The participants in the protests on "Black Friday" demanded wage increases, and they expressed their anger that the contribution to the operation of their own health insurance has risen from $30 to $100 a month.
A typical Wal-Mart, with workers, $9.5 deserves the time, could not afford the increase, they said.
Researchers from the University of California in Berkeley, show that if the company increased the average wage to 12 dollars an hour, it would cost Wal Mart 3.2 billion dollars.
The approximately 1.1% more than they now pay donations.
Wal Mart would pass the increases on customers, every purchase you only 46 cents more in the future.
per year would be for you today compared to more spending of only 12,39 dollars.
supporters of Wal Mart note with satisfaction that it only came to protests in nine states and the companies gave no losses.
The Black Friday took in his shop Thursday evening from 8 p.m. until midnight the next day, and in this period Wal Mart sold approximately 5,000 articles per second.
Overall, Wal Mart-funds on "Black Friday" almost 100 million transactions.
The company's spokesman, Dan Fogelman, claimed in an interview on the website of the left-leaning Huffington Post, that "less than five" Wal Mart-staff laid down the work and the protest only "another PR Stunt," the trade union, the protests have been organised.
"Free cash!"
The protests this week in New York, where their goal but not Wal Mart branches (which are not wanted in this progressive city and so far non-existent), but McDonald's and others were cheap restaurants.
McDonald's says the company sell billion chickens, and yet you provides no sick days, and you will not pay for your honest work.
New York City Council member Jumaane Williams
Currently, the minimum wage is $7.25 an hour under federal and New York legislation.
in fast-food restaurants, the minimum wage and increased, but not too much, and on average get their simple staff in New York 8,90 US dollar an hour.
Nobody in this expensive city less than they deserve.
as it is possible, in New York, with so little money, is beyond me.
There was a time when almost a quarter of all American young people after school at McDonald's was behind the counter, but the young people still lived with their parents.
hardly anyone saw is the main source of income or had to stay there longer.
now meet me in interviews with staff of McDonald's always people who complain that they do with this wage and sometimes even have to feed their children.
On the other hand, there is a comment in the forum of the Wall Street Journal newspaper, the author points out, it is irresponsible to have children, if you do not know how to feed them.
The participants in the protests, which at 6.00 a.m. before the McDonald's on Thursday began in the 40th Street and Madison Avenue, demanding that the cashier and cooks of fast-food restaurants receive a minimum wage of $15 an hour, which is more than a doubling of the current minimum wage.
They called for the formation of trade unions in the fast-food industry.
The US law prohibits it to stand in the way of corporate governance, this objective and trade unionists Abzumahnen or redundant.
On the other hand, the business leaders are not simply.
the establishment of trade unions in the fast-food industry is difficult but also for objective reasons.
The main reason is the high staff turnover.
unhappy
On this day, vocal protests, there were also many other fast-food restaurants in Manhattan.
The height of the protests was a house on at the McDonald's in Times Square, with some local Democrats languages, including city council member Jumaane Williams, said: "McDonald's says it sell billion chickens, and yet you provides no sick days, and will not pay for your honest work."
The demonstrators were also supported by other prominent New York Democrats, for example, Mayor candidate Bill de Blasio, said that "we should work together to support the fast-food workers, so that they can receive a fair wage and achieve economic prosperity, the all New Yorkers deserve."
According to the New York Times, this was the largest action of its kind in the history of the American fast-food industry.
However, only a few hundred people were on the ground, of which by far not all in the fast-food industry, working in the tens of thousands in New York.
It is not yet clear whether the spark of these protests will mobilise whole masses.
"The brain is so far only moderately on lists'
supporters of modern technology purveyors of the recently enlarged reality will usually seen through the lens of a special glasses.
first Google at its annual conference in the summer presented a working model in November was then aware that Microsoft had filed for a patent.
In talks with the head of the group for interactive 3D technology in Microsoft's laboratory in Cambridge Shahram Izadi, however, it is clear that the glasses for the scientists of the company was only a transit station.
It fascinates the possibility to manipulate virtual objects in the air with his bare hands and to create virtual free land.
- you briefly describe what research group.
We are dealing with the interaction of man and machine, however, want to expand the borders of this interaction.
So far, the largely stuck in the phase in which mankind with Pixeln worked on flat screens, sometimes will also be affected.
But we want to look ahead of 5-10 years and foresee the radical changes of this interaction.
For example, the Xbox console and Kinect sensors sold a progress, and these days, no more Xbox Kinect, as all for widespread interest.
what awaits us in the future?
- Although Kinect has brought the interaction on a physical level, plays a great deal still on the flat screen, sometimes in 3D.
The submission of information (the system receives more data) could be improved, the spending has not yet decisive.
We are trying to change, work on real three-dimensional presentation systems on the basis of various technologies, including projections.
We need the computer world in our physical world and make it comprehensible.
It is, however, essential that not only the users, but also its surroundings.
then we could complement the real world much easier by virtual objects.
First and foremost we should Bescheuerten virtual-reality helmets Los!
- what do you think about management?
It is popular, but it is not overvalued?
- it is certainly not the end solution, because it raises questions about privacy, because not all would like to inform others about his actions and intentions.
In fact, every kind of interaction with computers, but each in their specific niche.
For example, we were in the field of the management of objects on a project in which we in public places with short and narrow, with Ausladenden gestures-face.
The gestures were not the object of a bracelet, which recorded the movements of the camera, but registered bone and muscle.
Still, it is relatively large, but could in theory be reduced to the size of a wristwatch.
But, on the whole, however, the future joint management types, for example Gestik and language.
- How?
We would ask me, for example, this Sprudel Tin you rich?
They say it and, at the same time.
normally i say it simply.
- Oh, that would be very difficult to see.
- this means they want the users adapt to the what can make a machine at the time and what is not?
Not necessarily, but it is a mutual rapprochement.
In the next time, I think that we must be especially to work on the development of new types of sensor, which enable more reactions from people.
This can be laser sensors, for example, because they offer a good break in the deep, which is very important.
The demands on the basis of their work with the Xbox Kinect sensors to modern cameras?
There is a lack of dissolution, deep or something else?
The present generation is basically a good starting point for our work in the field of three-dimensional detection.
of course, 8 megapixel with a speed of 1000 FPS is not bad.
But the main thing is not the mega pixel itself, but the quality and the depth of the Matrix.
All current technologies are seen as not good enough for us, as the designer of the algorithms have more work.
It must not only along the dissolution of the X-, Y-, but also along the Z-axis will be taken into account.
The speed and the number of images per second are also important.
The movements of the people are extremely dynamic, and frankly, the current 30 FPS, especially for gestures to little.
Stephen Betishes contact in our laboratory in Redmond developed a sensor with a Regulierbaren processing delay between 1 to 100 milli-seconds, with today's commercial sensors are closer to the second value (60 to 100).
not all understand how much the interaction of man and machine.
I needed for my work as a device, only without contact management and with more images per second.
- the number of cameras should not be increased?
Kinect is currently working with three "cameras", with one of them, in fact, an infrared channels and the second is a recipient of the reflected signal.
and the third camera is indeed an ordinary RGB-camera.
It is not intended to calculate the object deep.
More cameras may solve the problem...
or increase the problem, since more calculations would be needed.
It would be nice to have a flexible, Kinect-like system where we could play with various camera orientation, to see how the in three-dimensional identifying a position helps us.
Microsoft presented-if I remember rightly, in contrast to Google's glasses were not to the public.
Do you not think that, in terms of the application of the technology of the enlarged reality in everyday life the lens has the best prospects?
- of course it is not pleasant, travelling to keep a smart phone in the hand, but I think the following: Tollste variant would be a "rotating" enhanced reality, we have a cloud of the glasses on the smart next May.
the lens is a personal gadget and therein lies its strength (private only you can see), but also its weakness, because a larger reality by means of glasses, that they can work together with other virtual objects.
Let us imagine for a moment that the manipulation of the virtual Hologramme in the air not only Tony stark is accessible from iron, but also human beings.
This idea, there is a problem, the critics often say: there is no tangible response.
The hands feel nothing at all!
What answers to their group at this point?
- in my lectures, I often talk that the enlarged reality the seventh breakthrough in the interaction between man and machine.
I believe the eighth breakthrough could well be the integration of Taktilen perception.
An interesting method is the use of a second hand rather unusual projection document.
It takes pressure very true!
But there are also technologies that are really aimed at "images in the air" something concrete, for example, the collision of some targeted ultrasound radiation in a certain point where the finger, but a feeling at the moment is still so fragile, as Pustete somebody on the hand ball.
There are also bands for the Commission on the nerve endings detect in the fingers, which is also a potential direction.
Have you tried to outsmart the brain?
We think that it is, what it should feel if it sees something?
- it is a good idea, so we have not tried.
Here lies another task, we will still have to fight for a long time, namely a person is physically in a closed space, to believe he was instead in an open, virtually infinite space here; we are working on concepts with course bands (other than in fitness studios), mobile platforms and large bullets.
So far, the brain only moderately on lists, and we still have many busy years.
that makes the work so attractive for researchers in the field of virtual reality: on many issues, we are only at the beginning.
its own taste rather than culture-Rosbalt.Ru
Rosbalt continued the "Petersburg vanguard" project, which is devoted to city dwellers, the vanguard of the art and culture.
On the elite list ended up already high-ranking representatives of the Petersburg art scene, whose achievements go beyond the borders of the city and often find recognition in Europe, without to be known in the rest of Russia.
The new hero of Rosbalt is the flamboyant artists Kirill Miller.
the whole town knows Kirill Miller, the Red-clad bearded, one time in the Russian Museum, the summer Garden, meeting with scene-or Vernis say found.
Wherever the images by Kirill Miller will also be issued to attract big crowds.
Kirill Miller is one of the typical Petersburg social philosophical artists create new myths.
Kirill Miller is a shining personality of the Petersburg vanguard of the late 1980s or early 1990s.
He is also a man of the city and its citizens a firework through its presence on the road you smile in the face and makes for good humour.
He recently Schnappte turn an organ recital and Petersburg turn organ recital players, as he was for this difficult role in relation to be artists feel life, his philosophy and his image is finally ready.
Kirill, why are you always in red and not, for example, in yellow and turquoise in the city?
I chose the colour red than fashion designer, the deals with the optics and image.
in this world is red the compromise between artists, spin-doctors and society.
The society calls for everything from the grey standard, aggression and bad behaviour.
But I do want my provocations come into contact with the people.
any of my last provocation was an invitation to talks.
- when Wusstest you, that you must be painters?
in an exhibition in the culture palace Newskij, were issued in my work.
I realised that I need to go down this road.
Then there was the time the old free, but not officially recognized painter to the end, and new and free painters such as I were incomprehensible.
I so friendly with the painters of the new generation, with the representatives of the "Gazonewschina"; it was "Pushkin kaja 10" and then was only once.
i prefer it to the theatre, to fashion, music, everything except the literature.
in your way-- and all the United Hospital...-it was important to me, in the heart of Petersburg culture, where the best creative artists should gather.
In 1995, I occupied a space in the Pushkin kaja 10, and there was a musical-artistic Club by the renovation work for the Boheme, the house of Petersburg Boheme.
Many were born there: N.O.M. Tequilajazzz and I also remember how string with his "ucho van Goga" project there.
string and his friends wore simple songs to play back, close ones and sang to them was also the edgy composer Igor Wdowin today.
When the group began to play live, was its "Leningrad".
Trachtenberg facilitated many programmes before the time of "halli Galli.
We gave them Trachtenberg, and his great career began, but the foundations got it in US.
The gallery also "d 137" or the club, "Griboedov" have their origin in the clinic.
There, our staff and guests.
I am a hero of the last century, when culture is still meant something.
In 2000, there was a survey in the press, in order to award "personalities of our city".
I won in the category "artists of the Year ', and so I was at the peak.
It is not easy to work in new times following the old rules; I am a man of truth, honesty and culture of the last century.
At the present time, it is easy to be famous, but culture and popularity are not the same: it can be known without a cultural contribution.
- your work have a distinctive style.
Many of my pictures are real pearls and express clearly the timeliness and thoroughness of the idea.
I will be an exhibition, with the theme "the Russian museum as clowns".
Clowns are timeless.
In the past I was socially, but now it pains and fear, to be the case.
blur in a clown all and loses its tragedy.
I love the grotesque, and bizarre ideas.
For example, we save the world by we require that everyone has fully to dress up.
Now, everyone on the clothing and focuses not on the external and internal.
But perhaps we should give people not spit, but he should face.
The deception disappears through the dress up.
We recently saw you in the role of the urban thing organ recital player.-a city should have a hero.
who, if not i?
- commercial art can also be beautiful?
- today must be careful of commercial art, considerate and flattering.
We see the disintegration of the cultures.
In the past, people were large groups: the Bohemiens loved and the ordinary people the other.
Now there are micro-communities, and it is difficult to please all.
I am not one hundred-dollar note, which everyone likes.
Now you've got you will consider who you like.
Every cult star now has around 100 followers.
The appearances by STAS Michailow but several thousand.
- abandoned him to be women, where the sexually-social sphere plays a role.
300 people for cultural reasons and not 10 thousand, so there is less money management, and everything is.
I voted in favour, and the most important thing is not to cheat and not to destroy it.
in my youth, I painted such images in a collectors even in a number with the works of Falk and Larionow.
I began with images, which normally come only at the end of the career.
Today, there are often misunderstandings.
It means: intellectual culture and consumer culture.
consumption has no culture, this is something quite different.
I am a man of the past culture and grew up with artists who lived in poverty and died in poverty and money, in order to be able to paint.
This is the culture, which I support.
Kirill, what is lacking-Petersburg?
- good culture experts.
We say: servant of the culture.
But not all of them can deal with culture.
The real czar, it was different, because the Tsars understood perhaps not much of culture, but they understood that right experts are needed.
In Moscow, there are currently good advisers.
In St. Petersburg, we have what could be the experts, but they blocked the road, because we need more high-level experts, which will evaluate the former right and pave the way for them.
now only one's own taste.
The same applies to the Erarta, but with the difference that they say that they do not accept all contemporary art and some painters must therefore seek other museums.
- What is St. Petersburg for you?
Moscow-Petersburg is not the capital of culture; there is much more culture and a breeding ground.
On our stones, art can only grow.
We need a cultural ground because, for example, we have now more writers than readers, and this is not right.
In Europe, there are many people who are curious, visit the exhibitions or concerts.
We are much less.
art must be back in fashion, as at the beginning of the last century.
The project is financed from grants the city of St. Petersburg
Born in outer space
planet in peril.
Global warming or clash with killer asteroid.
guiding caravans of spacecraft with earth people on board are on the search for a replacement planet.
In order to save humanity, is the important issue of how we in the zero gravity or the spare planet breed?
Many of the choice, in my opinion, there is not.
In fact, there are only two real planet, we could at least hypothetically inhabit.
"Mars and Venus", says the scientific staff of the astronomical Institute Sternberg-Vladimir sur Din.
However, while the conditions on Mars are comparatively life-friendly, there is a temperature of 500 degrees on the surface of Venus.
life would be only in height or in the orbit of Venus, in other words, all possible.
The issue of reproduction in all, the researchers first of all, in relation to the flora.
A half-century before being carried out experiments with plants.
The fourth generation of the in-orbit peas difference is not in the slightest by the Irdischen species.
The breeding of insects, followed by tiny fruit flies (Drosophila), in orbit.
In 1979, Wachtel eggs were sent into space to study the effects of zero gravity on the development of embryos.
It is a normal chicks.
But then the problem begins.
"The problem is that the chicks must stop; it must be able to stand on its feet and start to move," explained the head of the laboratory of the Institute of Medical-biological problems ran, Vladimir Sychew.
without firm underground Korean wild chicks.
ten hours later, Stumpften the instincts of the newborn.
The chicks were not reacting to the light and loud.
You then simply died four days later.
"twice we slip chicks and were all then, simply because it is impossible to work there with them," says Vladimir Sychew failed experiment with the chicks in all.
The last breeding cages of animals flew 16 years ago in the orbit.
In the spring of 2013 will continue the experiments.
However, the bio-satellite "Bion" only same-sex species.
It was an experiment, which already fertilized with rats have been sent into space.
In principle, it was nothing special.
"that was with the satellite, but once again, it was only a single experiment, biotechnology and research must continue," said Vladimir Sychew.
After landing the space rats offspring.
The issue of reproduction directly in space could not solve so far.
The task is difficult.
animals from their natural habitat can be simply do not follow their reproduction driving.
In contrast to animals that humans could in principle.
Homo sapiens is able to think Abstraktem and can generate a similar emotional background.
from ethical considerations, such experiments are not carried out.
But women fly for 50 years in all.
The greatest risk was Tereschkowa.
The most valuable that mankind is the female body.
Our MöWe flew and no one on earth would have been able to answer the following question: is the space flight?
After this flight, it will bring a child into the world?
"Finally, no one answered this question," says space veteran guard Tang Watschnadse.
In June 1964, only a year after their space flight, gave the first female cosmonaut Valentina Tereschkowa, a daughter.
The child's father, Andri Jan Nikolajew, was also kosmonaut.
In 1988, only the second woman in all, Svetlana Sawizkaja twice was in orbit and even work outside the space vehicle leisure, a son.
Nevertheless remains a risk.
We have only very few cosmonaut, after long flights, in which everything went well and healthy offspring.
"The more, the more dangerous it is even on flights in the orbit," concludes kosmonaut Valery Poljakow, hero of the Soviet Union and a hero of the Russian Federation.
But the mankind for new ways in the field of biotechnology, the radiation protection and generate artificial gravity.
The hydro-engineering laboratory in preparation for the centre of the cosmonaut preparation is a compulsory station during the flight.
The cosmonaut routine wins here in a state of flux for the work in open space.
The water is the zero gravity.
If adults water as pleasant, it is also a foreign environment, but babies feel water as a natural element.
It is, as would the small Ichtyander testimony to that life on the ocean emerged out of the country.
There is a connection between the fact that a child about 9 months in the belly of the mother in amniotic fluid, and that it can get easier access to water.
In principle this is logical, since from the birth until the first swim just 2 weeks.
"This is too little time to forget," says baby Swimming Teacher Marina Aksenowa.
While a newborn child the zero gravity is a much more natural state, the woman not without gravity.
In a situation of zero gravity is the Bauch- and basin muscles very quickly and that is also the capacity to extract the child.
Well, we avoid the introductory tool by birth.
The birth, for example, could also take place in a special chamber, extract for the child.
"But what happens then?" is the not insignificant matter of Valery Poljakow.
On the other hand the child also artificial gravity.
without requiring that they can train the organism the skeleton and muscles do not.
a newborn baby in-orbit not as an adult to training in a suit.
He is simply the absence, which is vital for his life.
"This experiment, we jointly, the birth of a child in a foreign environment, will lead to a disabled person, a completely Unangepassten will bring people to the world," says the head of the Ethics Commission of the Institute of Medical-biological problems slice, Igor Pestow.
So far, the birth of children in space is just a theory.
But at some point it will become reality if the people in their spacecraft to a distant planet, the home for their offspring born in all.
Nkú Chief: control of the black-system failed due to the fault of the policy
The Czech Republic has good control bodies and adequate laws in connection with public contracts, but back in their application.
In the conversation for AktuáLně.Cz says the Vice-President of the highest Control Office (Nejvyšší Kontrolní úřAd Nkú), Miloslav Kala.
"A law is never perfect, but it must be applied correctly-and I think that this is not the case with us," Kala comment on the current situation.
A similar result also appears to have a common control by Czech and German examiners.
He leads a negative practice example the attitude of Prime Minister Petr NečAs for the so-called "black-system."
Recently, the Prime Minister said that the ODS entrepreneurs would not trouble with controls-so the system is now banned or allowed?
"A law must have valid, and if something is prohibited by law, but is not simply the government chairman, and the control, whose duty is to hamper the monitoring of compliance with the law, in his work", Kala.
They spoke at the meeting of the monitoring committee of the Chamber of Deputies about a joint Czech-German project, under which the laws of both countries on public contracts were compared.
So what was it exactly?
there is a parallel investigation, with which we started about two years ago.
Simply put, it is a question that the European legislation, as public contracts to manage and build the national legislation. And finally, there is the real practical application.
all of this, we have compared with each other, and, although the investigation is not finished yet, we have seen very interesting differences. Generally speaking, perhaps even "with US laws are strict and perfect ', but the actual application is better in Germany in some of the parameters.
This confirms that it is not enough, always new and more precise rules. We must also deal with the actual application of the law.
How can you help the project? What is for them from this project?
just such a common control could help that we stop constantly perfecting the laws in order to try and the reduction and balancing of thresholds, if this evidently not particularly positive.
efficiency means one thing to a reasonable price (which is not always the lowest price) to acquire and illegal enrichment or even criminal acts.
But the lowering of the threshold values for contracts does not guarantee that we are achieving this objective.
Perhaps it is that the system in this way only with excessive 'paperwork', and those seeking loopholes in the system, it is much easier to exploit the system, remained higher than if the threshold values.
you talk about the problems in the practical implementation of the Czech law.
How does the system work in Germany?
There is a similar authority as our Nkú, or the system works differently?
As far as the authorities are concerned, the German equivalent to Nkú the federal court that is built, and also has a college that is slightly different in principle both authorities to be formed, but similar.
The skills are comparable to a certain extent, but Germany is a federal state, in other words that there is this federal courts in the individual countries, the German system is different from our own.
The Brh can only control federal funds, consistent with our national resources.
public funds, which will be managed by the counties and municipalities, under the control of the country's courts.
What the German legislation is easier than ours?
In general I would compare without specific information only reluctantly. Nevertheless, Germany is often described as a model in some ways, but it is certainly not to say that Germany in particular is better.
This is perhaps because the auditors are better?
Certainly not, but as I said, such comparisons may I do not particularly like.
This is worth noting that even those countries that are a model for us, also have problems to contend with.
Otherwise you would have nothing of the cooperation with our authority, not true?
What the Czech legislation, which was important for their authority to review the procurement law, feel they have any impact?
In view of the fact that this amendment is, in force for only a short time, it is not in our tests so far.
Since our controls take place, we must here with some delay.
We feel effects have so far been rather controls in the preparatory phase of the future-we have introduced the new instrument of control "identification of risks of waste," and with this almost 14,000 public contracts examined and analysed-This will effect the changes, of course, since the threshold values change the conditions for certain types of tenders have been modified and others
you see the adoption of this law rather positive, or the system will be burdened with additional bureaucracy?
I think that this law is certainly a step in the right direction, and I hope that this adoption.
The problem, however, is that the rules can be "strict" and can no longer be met.
Under the previous rules are a test Unterzogenen persons against the winner (for example, in the event of the operational programme of regional policy, the Regional Council) accountable, that any failure of the procurement law is tantamount to a breach of discipline.
But it is useful to make the law more stringent?
I do not think this way.
The system must exclude those who attack and want to abuse the system, and not penalise those who have committed a mistake, not the actual decision-making.
Such a system is only the bureaucracy under even greater pressure.
Where is the way out?
We say, first of all, what is not successful.
The prime minister recently said that the ODS entrepreneurs would not bother with control of the so-called "black-system '- What exactly does this mean?
The black-system is now banned or allowed?
A Bill must have valid, and if something is banned by law, but it is not just the Government can control, whose duty is the chairman, and the monitoring of compliance with the law, in its activities.
He can say: "we need to change the law and allow the cause", but he can'T say that we act as if nothing had happened.
The procurement law contains relatively strict rules on the formal implementation of certain transactions-and this is for the protection of the public competition.
On the other hand, but it is also tragic if the bidder with the best offer simply because of procedural irregularities.
The law will never be perfect, but it must be applied correctly-and I think that is what we are lacking.
On the streets, there is occasionally ice GläTte, but mostly they are dry.
On the streets of the Czech Republic is partly Schnee- and ice GläTte.
However, most of the roads are good line, sometimes, increased caution.

In the district of karlsbad, good line the streets this morning, there was Schnee- and ice GläTte.
The temperatures fell to -5 -10 ° C during the day should be a bit warmer.
not snowing now in the region, and in the high altitudes is only a thin snow cover.
However, the KäMmen ore mountain are approximately 30 cm of snow.
According to the District Road rescue because of fog limited view.
The highway R6 and transport of first-class roads in the region are currently fully navigable.
However, attention is on bridges, for example, where the lanes are sometimes frozen and slippery.
line are also all road transport routes in the second and third class, including the mountain roads.
However, on these roads remain section Vereiste or from lack of snow remains.
particularly in the higher areas is therefore increased attention is needed.
counties of Pardubice and hradec KráLové
on some roads east of Bohemia risk because ice GläTte in higher areas, and a lack of snow in the mountains on the streets, sometimes with class, shares the road and motorway Directorate on their websites.
The StraßEnmeistereien warning drivers about ice GläTte can occur, particularly in the higher were in Pardubice district.
ice GläTte, particularly on routes to the second and third class in the streets LanšKroun, úStí nad Orlicí PoličKa, svitavy and Vysoké MýTo.
The roads I / 43 and I / 34 chemically treated in svitavy.
Snow is especially in the giant mountains on the streets and in the mountains Orlické hory.
A lack of snow class lies in high altitudes on the roads of the circles in rychnov nad KněžNou and Trutnov.
In east Bohemia is mostly sunny and pleasant, and today it remains largely reflected.
The temperatures are moving between -3 ° C and + 1, a weak wind is blowing it.
District pilsen
The roads in the district Pilsen are well navigable, locally is increased attention is needed, however, and the style is to adapt to the weather.
This is the morning chill, with temperatures between 3 and 9 degrees below the freezing point.
Since then it has snowed earlier and temperatures fell, it can come on the streets to ice GläTte.
Local is also to reckon with fog will improve during the day, however, with the term.
These data come from BezirksstraßEnmeistereien.
The D5 motorway is practically fully navigable, but increased attention recommend StraßEnmeistereien between the 80th and 131 kilometres.
the lanes of the first class are mostly dry, but through icy streets.
In the south of the Pilsen and tachov, however, it can come to ice GläTte, section.
the lanes in the second and third-class roads are wet, and therefore also the reference to possible Vereiste sections.
drivers, mainly on the less used roads should be particularly careful in the Bohemian forest area.

šImon Ornest: on our concerts, we want positive energy collection
What do you think that the world should take place in less than a month?
This is one of those disasters reports to the people we like function.
We make with our band the tap tap more about fun and say that we are the only band in the world, which can gather enough positive energy in order to prevent or to stop the world.
achieve a unique project with three concerts in December against the world.
Can you imagine our readers the project closer?
It is a nationwide fundraising event we plan two years.
We want to use the marketing potential of the Mayan calendar, which end on 21 December is forecast at 11: 10 a.m..
The day before, on 20 December, from 21: 00 p.m. at the same time three concerts in Prague, Brno and Ostrava.
The end of concerts should be around at the time, on the Pacific island of Kiribati, which lies before us in a time zone to 12 hours, the Mayan calendar ends.
Where did this idea come from?
Originally from me, then we have the idea together with our Grafiker Honza Augusta.
We would like not only sufficient positive energy, in order to prevent the end of the world, but we also want to consider, together with the public, the state in which we give our children about this world.
At the end of the Mayan calendar, we also have a unique Kollektion of shoes, T-shirts, bags and key supporters of the developed world, with their purchase on Www.E-Tap.Cz people can also support us.
The band the tap tap, together with other performers also called anthem against the end of the world comes with the title of 'world ".
The national anthem on YouTube is already very popular. They will also be at the fundraising concerts ring?
of course, and in the end, provided that all the work and the world does not take place...
The national anthem should be sung by all actors at all three concerts at the same time.
In addition, the anthems in a direct line from the Czech television broadcast live.
The text of the anthem by Tomáš HanáK, who plays the main character of Jesus in the video clip, also Xindl X sings with...
As they have come to the cooperation with two?
We also cooperate with other figures in the Czech culture scene, was linked to the fact that we implement many fundraising events and concerts...
We are trying to integrate these people involved in our projects.
It has shown that the most interested in working with us, and have fun.
What is the proceeds of the benefit concerts against the end of the world?
for the establishment of a barrier-free education centre Studeo we already six years working together with the club tap JedličKa Institute.
the pupils of the JedličKa Institute are regularly cared for by teachers, to help them in various leisure activities.
As the pupils themselves do not have the resources to the teachers, we want to help them in this way.
In the framework of the completion of the JedličKa Institute is a separate building in which we then with this project.
Each concert, several groups and performers.
According to what criteria they have selected?
We wanted to put together a programme that addresses all the generations including children.
For example, China in Prague ski, Support Lesbiens illu stratosphere with Dan BáRta, the tap tap, MariáN Bango and Jiří Suchý.
they know everything further on the website Www.Kpks.Cz.
similar "big events" are planned for the future?
We are for the first time in May at the Prague Spring, and also for this concert, we are preparing an interesting programme with interesting guests.
Next year, we would also like the Czech House in New York, and I personally, if we are in the United States-then this would also like to associate with appearances in Washington and Chicago.
their overseas plans are not just small, yet they are already in Madrid, Brussels, London and Moscow.
However, the tap tap is composed of a group of people with disabilities.
as you travel this logistical and organisational?
It is not as bad as it seems at first glance.
five of our members are wheelchair users, i.e. the wheelchairs must be carried in the luggage area. We must also, of course, many instruments towing suitcases and other luggage...
Nevertheless, it has always worked without problems, čSa and British Airways were always very well prepared for us, that I sometimes even surprised me.
Even in Moscow, where we were, there were no problems recently.
Through their travel abroad, they have a comparison, how it looks in the individual countries with accessibility, how we deal with disabled people, etc.
How have you seen these things so far?
After Madrid, Luxembourg, London and other cities, where everything works better than us, especially in Russia, we witnessed that is still in its infancy in the East.
Moscow is absolutely not accessible to Prague. It is still unusual, if someone is travelling alone in a wheelchair in the city centre.
It is not even there, of course, that a wheelchair users, for example, in the lift.
Fortunately there clubs, too, trying to draw attention to the problems of people with disabilities.
and in what ways we need to catch up with the more developed countries?
There are many things on which we depend on...
note, however, that an improvement in the situation is also always depends on the efforts of the parties concerned.
in London and Madrid, it is common for people with severe disabilities itself constantly in the public area can move into a museum, toilets etc.
But it is not just that a larger group of disabled people are actively involved in social events with the band the tap tap slightly ahead of the West.
public respect and accessibility is one thing, but only if significant from our ranks athletes, artists, actors, politicians and lawyers, are things really begin to change.
So far, only individual cases of particularly strong personalities.
The tap tap is very popular at the moment, but if we go back a few years: What has motivated in 1998, to set up a band?
I then began as carers in JedličKa Institute, where I met many young people who were interested in to deal with something hard.
Among other things, and because I am a musician and Saxofon Games, along with a colleague, I have established a music company.
and with time, as our host, LáďA Angelovič to say, something out of control (laughs).
But the band was known only in the last few years, or am I wrong?
It is true that the cooperation with well-known singers helped us; we have also started to promote active for us.
we realised that if you are doing something and not to see this outwardly, their own performance, in a sense, does not exist.
Thanks to EU funding, we can also make good teachers, high-quality equipment and etc.
It was their goal to bring it with the tap tap so far?
from the beginning, I felt the potential that we can tackle the things differently.
Often the other copies in show business today.
in its own way, it is only logical, because everything new is viewed with caution and accepted only after some time.
There are few really unique things and, I would venture to say that it includes tap tap.
The first impression of the spectators usually has, naturally, is, of course, with suffering; this is just...
But this compassion is absolutely unnecessary, because people with disabilities are not lonely and deserted nature, which we regret.
There are people living a full life and can develop, provided they have the necessary resources.
I always say that if people with disabilities something, this is a step forward not only for themselves, but for the whole of society.
It was for this success, it is also helpful that a strict head, how many people are you listening?
If you want to make something good, in many things, we must not compromise and must also demand a certain discipline.
But I think this is quite normal.
Some people come to us with romantic ideas, and if they discover that they have twice the week test preparation must go and spend a lot of time to travel on concert stages, then quickly extinguished the enthusiasm among many.
But it works everywhere, in every band that wants to work hard and achieve something.
Currently, the tap tap has 20 members.
How many of them were, from the outset, since 1998?
only one: LáďA Angelovič.
We are an open group. The people come and go, we cannot prevent.
who has the will and the desire to participate, we always welcome.
taking place the day before the world predicted Thursday the 20.12.2012 at 9 p.m.
venues: Incheba-arena / PRAGUE FléDa / Brno and Plynojem / Ostrava; 12 Czech bands and musicians
All three venues will finally, linked by live interconnection and overcome a common interpretation of the anthem "doomsday," the band the tap tap.
The aim of the Konzertes, to raise funds for the provision of a multifunctional disabled education centre, under the name Studeo JedličKa Institute in Prague. Czk cost: 25 million
The entry costs 400 Czk, children until 12 years free of charge, the cards are available in the sale in Bohemia ticket.
Poland and the space.
Poland was last week at a meeting of the Council of Ministers of the member countries of the European Space Agency ESA as twentieth member of this space authority. Poland is the second member state from the former eastern bloc (after the Czech Republic, which was on 12 November 2008 ESA member).
Poland began in 1994 with a close cooperation with the European Space Agency (ESA) and participated in the following years several ESA projects.
But the way the space in Poland began much earlier.
before the Second World War workers Polish Cosmos fans with the space, and they are not always understanding.
I refer for example to the presentation of A. šTernfeld on 6 December 1933 in Warsaw Observatory, the idea of the author from his pioneering work 'entrance to Kosmonautik'.
The ideas of the young engineer (1905), the audience to users, but cold and after years reminded šTernfeld that only Dr Jan Gadomski had shown interest in his work.
In the year 1934 šTernfeld won for "entrance to Kosmonautik" by Robert Esnault-Prix reps-donated Pelterie and André Louis Hirsch Hirsch.
Dr Jan Gadomski (1899-1966) was later an important supporter of the astronomy and space.
He wrote hundreds of articles and several books published in Polish newspapers to these scientific disciplines.
Gadomskis recognised worldwide contribution to the development of space, inter alia, that the Krater Erdabgewandten side of the moon was named after him.
already in the year 1925 a rail Draisine was built in Poland, was planned for the missile propulsion.
Unfortunately, the author of the text and the details of this project, remained unknown.
it is not even clear whether the missile should be used to start or stop the Draisine.
The information come solely from the contemporary press.
In 1933, the Polish infantry started to deal with rocket-powered bullets.
The research led Professor Mieczyslaw Wolfke KomóRka tech Niki Uzbrojenia in cooperation with the Institute and Prof. Gustaw Mokrzyckiegi.
It is clear from the traditional documents that the research into the stage of practical tests was reached.
But the research was then suspended by the invasion of the German Wehrmacht.
In 1937, appeared in the press of the draft a photo from ing. RohozińSki electric rocket, and in the following year, the hunting "raki ETA Torpeda Powietrzna I Rakietobomba Lotnicza 'the author Leliwa Krzywoblocky.
Both projects dealt with the military use of rocket propulsion.
On the eve of the war, all the projects on the military use of missile technology from temporary Scientific Advisory Committee (Tymczasowy Komitet Doradczo-coordinated Naukowy).
The Committee was established in 1937, after two years of work was completed its work, however, by the beginning of the war.
Another appeared to space after the war, thanks to the work of the Polish aerospace company (polskie Towarzystwo Astro Nautyczne) in the Polish press.
The first mention of this society in the November edition of the magazine problemy in 1954 in the four major articles of the space.
The article by Professor M. Subotowicz contains the proposal of establishing a space company.
At the time there were already the first projects for satellite technology, and it was clear that the exploration of space future would have.
already in its inception in 1956, the Polish space society PTA to accede to the 1951-based International Federation for space and, indeed, the PTA was already 1956 due in the autumn.
The following year, was the first PTA Chairman, Kazimierz Zarankiewicz (1902-1959), vice-chairman of the International Federation for space.
In this post he had held until his death in 1959.
since 1956, the PTA in the forefront of the development of the very successful meteorological rocket (raki ETA Meteorologiczna), the first Polish missile for scientific research.
The first type, the RM-1, was completed in 1957, the first start was on 10 October 1958.
The missile with a maximum altitude of 1800 metres was 80 cm long and weighed not quite 5 kg.
Later, an improved version, the RM-1A, was built in 1959 and began in the BłęDóW desert flight tests of the two-stage missile RM-2.
The missile was 1.4 metres long and weighed around 11.5 kg.
A further development stage should already be in a position to provide real scientific work-RM-34 rocket should reach a height of up to 14.5 km and for the monitoring of high winds.
In 1962, however, was the further development.
RM, the successor to the first missiles of the type Meteor-1-Rakete developed in the years from 1962 to 1965.
The rocket was conceived as a two-stage rocket, its total length of fraud 510 cm and the take-off weight was 32.5 kg.
This missile were developed three types (Meteor-1A, -1B and -1C), from differences in the size of the transport area for scientific instruments.
The Meteor-1A rocket had a transport area with 0.4 litres capacity, Meteor-1B on 0,34 per litre and Meteor-1C 0,62 litres.
The maximum height in all three types of fraud 37 km.
In the years 1965-1968 was in the aviation institute developed the meteor-2-Rakete, whose first flight tests began in October 1970.
Meteor-2 had a take-off weight of 380 kg and was in a position to make a useful weight of 10 kg in an amount of approximately 60 km.
then the versions were built Meteor-2H and Meteor-3.
It is also worth noting the accession of Poland to the cospar (Committee for space research) in 1960, and two years later was followed by the creation of a national COS par-Committee.
Poland also participated in the context of the cosmos-programme with Soviet satellites in space research, and, in 1978, the Polish pilot Miroslaw Hermaszewski, after the Czechs Vladimir Remek second international kosmonaut.
The repeal of the law on voluntary work is not the solution.
In the last week, the constitutional court the law on voluntary work.
This decision caused a lively debate in the public.
It is interesting to look at the issue from a wider perspective.
The liberal-oriented economies in the EU and in the globalised world based on the principle of unregulated economic competition.
In the final analysis, this means that the individual economies in a permanent conflict with each other.
This is the principle of free trade and the free, unrestricted movement of private capital, which goes hand in hand with rampant financial speculation.
Due to the large differences of the value of work (wages) when it comes to price tensions.
To understand this concept is a condition in which the manufacturers trying to import cheaper goods in economic competition, by undercutting the competition "', in order to seize a larger market share and to increase their profits.
on a large scale, this means for most companies to transfer their manufacturing abroad or buy cheap, or abandon their business. The result is a high level of unemployment in countries with comparable high labour costs.
Since the private capital is not social responsibility and also bears no responsibility for the unemployment caused by him, are necessarily the spending increase.
This situation is compounded by the fact that the gentlemen entrepreneurs are absolutely unwilling to pay their taxes and the overall economic and social damage caused by them.
This situation is well known, so that specific statistics are unnecessary at this point.
The reckless practice of private capital in the individual economies will create a situation in which the governments are forced to compete with each other in order to artificially reduce the social level of their own people and to attract foreign capital into the country.
In other words, governments provide their own people without regard to the social consequences of the private capital.
This manifests itself in particular amendments to existing laws.
The aim of these measures is to force its own people, to accept the dictates of private capital, particularly in terms of wages.
This is an economic force in long-term unemployment, on the other hand, by restricting the rights of workers.
The result is increased poverty and widening disparities between rich and poor.
for several years in Germany, there are public food distribution to the poor, which are no longer in a position to feed, through their own work.
The number of people already in the millions.
in the wake of increasing the competitiveness of the German economy is regularly given to cases in which workers such a low salary, that the state must increase their income until the subsistence level.
such a scandal was also in the case of workers exposed in the German Bundestag.
The austerity measures of practically all EU-Southern States will undoubtedly be in the same situation, in which the people under the pressure of a disastrous crash of their social levels are forced to emigrate (as was the case in the 19th century), or for a pittance, on the fringes of society to languish, and I hope that at some point private investment capital will flow into the country.
This is naturally the question of where this capital?
If it comes from another EU country, moves the poverty of; or the capital remains the same from one country to another, because in China, India, Brazil, Turkey, Morocco or Egypt and Africa at work for a fraction of the salaries of the employees.
This concerns the whole of Latin America.
ad nauseam Liberal theories and the media claim that the state must not involved with capital in its own economy and that economy could lead to economic disaster.
The private, parochial, insists on its position that the state should not intervene directly in the economy.
then, however, we must ask whether the private policy and therefore the whole state influenced or even in their own selfish interests.
The clear answer is: yes.
proof of this is the existence of a virtually omnipotent and omnipresent lobby in all member states.
The result is a desperate situation in the field of legislation, the corruption, the mutual benefit, virtually everything is criminally punishable, but nothing.
In Germany, the situation is such that a State Department lack of finances private, closely interdependent with the industry law firms charged with the preparation of draft legislation.
The draft law will be then passed in the Bundestag.
all the violence is no longer, as the western constitutions, but from the people of strong financial groups with their own interests.
Obviously the liberal democracies soon in a situation at the moment, as you APP Ian in his work on the crisis of the Roman Republic when Caesar and Pompeius' describes: "The state was long in the break, and the offices were filled with violence.
bribes, illegal or fraudulent use of benefits with stone and sword.
corruption has grown incontinent, and people with already buy votes on election "..." people with character applied for not for offices, so that the state as a result of this decline for eight months had no consul "..." we already really began to speak about the fact that the only medicine in this serious situation was a dictatorship, and that a strong man... should be chosen "APP Ian thought although Pompeius, but the strong man was then Caesar, the democracy permanently replaced by the dictatorship.
As it turns out, based on today's society as well as in ancient times on the ruthless preference to their own advantage, without overall interests of society.
private capital is by its very nature, is not in a position to see the benefit of the whole of society.
The result, now as then, is an unparalleled decadence of the elites, not in the slightest for deeper reforms.
The reason for the rise of fascism and communism in the indiscriminate liberalisation of the economy, we must therefore find systems in the 19th and 20th century.
from today's situation, can be regarded as certain break the fall of this regime for the liberal democracies, already in the next round.
particularly disastrous is the fact that today's elites the loss of hundreds of thousands of lives in the future, the social and humanitarian disasters, we have already witnessed, and crimes against humanity, as we know from the history of older and newer, in complete ignorance.
The lifting of the law on voluntary work here is not the solution, or at least not lasting.
Under pressure from the global and European economic competition, Czech Republic will be forced to continue to seek ways to push down the level of social security of the population.
This trend is therefore bound.
The only solution targeted political and social reforms, the capital increase the state participation in the economy, increase the influence of the citizens on the Government and weaken the monopoly of private capital in society for the benefit of the state.
Israel: laboratory of the chaos.
"... that nothing from violence occurs, or ever could be," sings Song fragile, Sting, whose main verse in the refrain is: "... so that we do not forget how fragile we are."
"When my sons were no wars, there would be no", says the dying well Ele Schnaper, wife of Mayer Amschel Rothschild, in 1849
Following the recent wave of violence between Israel and the Gaza Strip, as always, there were a host of reactions.
the one behind Israel and argue with the right to self-defense, while the Palestinians as terrorists; the other, in turn, support the Palestinians argue with the racism of the Israeli state, with the call of the Palestinian Arabs committed genocide and the state of Israel as a terrorist.
At this point I would not write about who these recurring waves of killing guilty and who the victim; in the end, the residents of Israel today were born into the areas including self-management in the current political situation and we have not seen the beginning of the violence itself.
I am talking about the readers look to open up the behind the scenes look at whom the 95 years tension (expected from the Balfour Declaration in November 1917) in the small patches of land in the Middle East in particular.
My thoughts are based partly on accessible historical facts, others are deduced from this and from my own understanding of who or what group of people strongly affected the events in modern history.
The history of humanity is primarily a story of the struggle for power.
in every era, we can represent a Alexander the Great or a Napoleon.
What is less obvious is the question of whether it really always these figures were autonomous, their steps, or whether their throne someone of their actions to a specific goal.
We must admit that we live in a time in which the world's wealth concentrated in the hands of a few individuals, and that this concentration of money and the resulting power not live within the span of a generation.
Among these astronomical rich families, a particularly stands out, which could be described as the head of the Octopus have (I do not know whether you have someone, but I cannot agree with this)-the Rothschilds.
much will not be written on them.
understandably.
The first press agency (Reuters) was bought in the 1990s by the Rothschilds of the 19th century, in order to prevent its name with high criminal, whose background is still consolidating their power, to increase their wealth, or both.
The Rothschilds are involved in almost all the world's central banks, and the central banks of the countries in which they are involved, they prepare wars or this (before the attack on Afghanistan, there were seven countries, after the attack on Iraq, there were five countries, following the fall Ghaddafis only four, and Russia remained in the meantime, his bank has suggested the Russian government).
Anyone who has tried to confront this family, had to pay with their lives.
Abraham Lincoln refused to renew the status of the Rothschilds of Bank of America as a central bank, began during the civil war, launch their own (read: State) notes and 1865 was murdered in a theatre.
J.F. Kennedy began to publish their own banknotes and wanted to abolish the Fed-he was murdered in 1963; the Honourable Member Louis MC Fadden was poisoned in 1936 after he wanted to sue the Fed for triggering the Great Depression in 1929.
The global power designs the Rothschilds of the years 1859-led to the drafting of a plan for the unleashing of three world wars in 1871 by Albert peak, a freemason of 33rd and highest level of recognition.
The first war was aimed to remove the large monarchists States nature of Europe, by the second war should be broken the colonial rule of Britain, in particular, and the third war should reduce the world's population on about 0.5-1 billion people (such a number would ensure their comforts and luxury and would not create so many resources), a universal religion (the ecumenism is nothing more than the run-up) and finally lead to the assumption of absolute power.
The method by which the group of the richest families is working with the Rothschilds at the top, triggering a crisis and the subsequent offer a solution (order the chaos from Chao-order).
But these solutions are wrong and always lead to the worsening of the situation (see the creation of the Fed, so that crises such as the one you not repeat triggered in 1907).
After you managed by the murder of the Habsburg throne Ferdinand in Sarajevo, triggering the First World War, destroyed the Russian empire by the revolution, the Bolsheviks.
The first world war ended with the sudden, militarily and economically unjustified surrender of Germany (for the destruction of the Russian tsarist, the war was no longer necessary), then the dissolution of the Central European power was Austria-Hungary.
In order to be able to make easier the second world war, the bankers by the policy a latent conflict situation by Germany with huge war reparations documented; it created to impoverished masses, so that they had to cheer the German only a sufficiently strong leaders, offered simple solutions, named the guilty and Czechoslovakia; another factor was the creation of the group with a strong German minority, should play the role of a fifth column and also, to the war fire.
At the end of the 19th century, the Rothschilds initiated the founding of the Zionist movement, in a branch of the establishment of a state for the Jews: JudäAs with Jerusalem as its capital, if possible, at the historic area (return to Zion).
the Balfour Declaration, mentioned earlier created the conditions for the mass immigration of Jews to Palestine; it came to the first clashes with the local Arab population.
there were terrorist attacks on both sides.
The Second World War broke out, and whether Hitler broke the chain of the international bankers had initially thought, or if everything went according to plan, it is hard to assess, in any case, the plight of European Jews in concentration camps created the basis for the recognition of the Jewish state by the world community.
Israel was founded in 1948, and as well as by the war reparations was against Germany to prepare the ground for the second world war, the declaration of the state of Israel is the creation of the one point for the third world war.
If the international bankers will be able to unlock this war, the Jewish people as the victims in the front line in the fight in the second world war, this time with the Arab and Muslim people of the Middle East.
Israel is like a huge laboratory, a source of dispute and the chaos, not only within the country itself, but also international (just think of how strongly people into supporters and opponents of Israel).
who is guilty and who is the victim in the conflict between the Palestinians and the Israelites, where wrong just wrong in an endless spiral of violence, and at the beginning of the greed of the individual and their quest for global power?
We must distinguish between the citizens of Israel and its leaders here, but the international bankers, in Israel as well as we, the people, exclusively their own candidates for the election.
The current prime minister of Israel, the hawkish Netanyahu, is a typical example of a vulnerable, the international bankers fascism loyal politician, of which is doing in order to provoke a war with Iran, which in the face of Iran's membership in the Shanghai Cooperation Organization (China, India, Russia, Pakistan,...), a global conflict could spread quickly, and with Iran, because of the control on just 2 miles wide Strait of Hormuz, through which 20% of global oil supplies, could come to a destruction of the world economy.
In the light as the words of David Rockefellers from the 1994: "The only thing we need is an arching crisis, and the people will welcome the new world order."
in its presentation, the new world order is a world of masters and slaves.
a world in which the rest of the human population of the small group of financial aristocrats.
a world in which every newborn in the birth of a chip implanted in order to submit this nature of total control.
"and it does, that the small and large, and the rich and the poor, which is free and all the servants a time signal in their right hand, or in their face, that no one can buy or sell it because the time signal, the name of the animal or the number of his name.
here is wisdom, who has common sense, giving the number of the animal.
because it is a human figure, and his number is six hundred sixty-six. "
The film Argo: if it's the worst Hollywood call
In November 1979 demonstrate a mob of Islamist students occupied the American embassy in Tehran and took 52 diplomats hostage.
for their release, they were asking for the extradition of the deposed shah Mohammad Reza Pahlavi, fled after the revolution in the United States, which for decades had maintained the patronage of his regime.
There was no positive outcome from this situation for the American government, they could not afford, to throw out the Shah, as this would have severely damaged the confidence of their allies in other countries.
At the same time, it was not in the situation in Iran, where the revolution resulted in the establishment of a theocratic regime to secure the release of the hostages.
It was a serious blow to the reputation of the United States, and the subsequent fiasco in the violent attempt to retrieve made things even worse.
The captured diplomats were finally released after 444 days after negotiations mediated by the Algerian government.
The fate of the hostages caused a wave of solidarity and anti-Iranian sentiments at home.
The debacle in Iran contributed significantly to defeat Jimmy Carter against Ronald Reagan in the 1980 presidential election.
The director and actor Ben Affleck's Argo film describes an episode of this history, gave the United States a small part of the victory.
immediately before the occupation of the embassy managed six embassy staff fled.
This came after numerous complications in the residence of Canadian ambassador.
The CIA, in cooperation with the Canadian authorities to bring the refugees from Iran; helping them a flamboyant story on the cover of their true identity-they travelled with Canadian passports allegedly turn in the country disguised as members of a film at the places visited for a science-fiction movie.
The combination of genres
The plan developed by experts for "Exfiltration", Tony Mendez, also made the necessary cooperation of Hollywood.
The cover was credible, article published in journals, conferences have been held on this film project and the fictitious production society had a real office.
The details of the operation were long kept secret. The film is based on the memoirs of Tony Mendez.
Afflecks film is a particular combination of film genres.
On the one hand, it is a realistic political thriller, but at the same time also a so-called 'caper movie "-- the story of a successful Husaren piece such as the film Ocean's Eleven.
This change in the documentary film the mood levels, on the one side (in the title sequence Ikonische contemporary photographs showed scenes from Tehran, and in the film version of the same situations, there are no great differences).
On the other hand, the loose passages from Hollywood, the ironic and easily taken.
And then there are the scenes from the CIA headquarters and other institutions-men in suits at the meeting table, in the official Gallery, on the phone...
Ben Affleck, this film is a remarkable revival of his career.
A BeläChelten actor has become a respectable Director, as well as actors, it is now no longer the target of ironic comments.
argo is his third game film for the thriller not easy (gone baby gone, 2007) and the thriller city without mercy (2010).
At the same time it is Afflecks first film not in the local Boston director.
The sense of the atmosphere of the place belonged to the characteristics of the previous films, the director of the standard Hollywood contrasted with the more general.
Affleck proves this sense but also in Argo, where Tehran "played" by Canada.
The best scenes of the film play in the streets and demonstrate the reconstruction of events which have taken place-the first sequence of the storming of the embassy is very impressive in its clarity and feeling yet Verwirrtheit and the unpredictability that comes when moving somewhere the history.
A similar effect Affleck with his team in fictional scenes (the wrong film staff in a bazaar in Tehran).
too much action in too many places
The director also had to face up to the fact that history really does not offer many exciting scenes in cinema sense.
with the few working but quite successfully, it helps sometimes, the reality-was not always so elegantly (the scenes in which the impending crisis is averted by a telephone call at the airport in Tehran in America, or the persecution of hunting on the runway, something curious).
The weakness of Argo is too broad distribution, which is determined by the need to act too much in too many places to show.
Alan Arkin and John Goodman in their roles as Hollywood workers are very charming, but their characters could have more space and they are not alone in the film by far.
Afflecks film that loses traction. It is a film, with some interest and the design and the retro-style, reminiscent of a thriller from the 70th years Goutieren.
He inspires enthusiasm, however difficult.
Today, in some way as a reminder of a living piece of history and, as proof, such as excessive but the ideas of the omnipotent and omniscient secret services, but it is enough.
directives for bubbles of balloons, for bananas and for the circus
The server Www.Bankovnipoplatky.Com, the annual survey on the oddest of bank charges, has decided that the competition this year, "most absurd regulation or idea-workshop" from the EU.
"This idea has brought us the plan put forward by the EU, a 40% quota of recently introduced in the management of large European companies," said Patrik Nacher, cares about the organisation of this survey, to the Právo newspaper.
Among the nominated absurdities is, for example, the judgment of the European Court of Justice on the unification of the insurance rates for men and women.
In the meantime, women enjoyed an advantage in life insurance, because they pose a lower risk for insurance companies objectively.
"Another incredible cases from the workshop can be nominated by the end of this year.
The vote will take place by the end of February 2013, "said Nacher.
One of the controversial EU regulations including the binding mixture of Bioethanol fuel in its wake, nature is harmful to the ban on the reliable contain mercury thermometers, only because this is a relatively small amount of this dangerous substance, or the directive on cages, but because of the size of chicken eggs this year were much more expensive.
criticism has in the past, the de facto ban on the use of the term "proliferation" or even the sales ban traditional light bulbs.
bananas must be 14 cm long
The EU machine decides often under the pressure of this or that lobby for trade and industry, whose demands are represented in Brussels the rule of one or more member countries (for example, currently Czech Republic is trying to enforce the demands of Czech banks also veto-threat).
also lobbying interests were behind that bananas from the highest trade class in the EU must be at least 14 cm long and curvature anomaly "must not '.
The European Commission defended with the argument that it is only the fragmented national standards would impede trade Harmonisiere.
The standards for fruit and vegetables by the EU against the resistance of some countries have already been softened by pointing out that the existing directives would lead to a waste of food.
A candidate for the victory in this survey is perhaps the EU regulation last year, according to the balloons in the sale must be labelled with the suggestion that children under eight years the air balloon without the supervision of an adult to bubbles.
The EU stood on a US study, according to the balloons are the leading cause of death by suffocation of children.
A similar restrictions already applies to children up to 14 years in the use of the JahrmarktströTen.
There is also the strange thoughts at home
relatively absurd is also a directive, which concerns the European officials itself-each, an official role in the EU, because of the sensitivity of the issue for Greece must not use the name Macedonia and must instead FYROM (former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia).
The server BankovníPoplatky.Com nominee in cooperation with the Association of liberal economists laissez-faire, in addition to the above-mentioned also the absurdities of the EU regulation on the volume of food supplies to the territory of a member country.
The EU, the highest volume of food stocks, on the day of our accession to the EU was located on the territory of the Czech Republic.
The Czech Republic exceeded the volume of canned mushroom, which we set out, for example, then a large fine.
The organizers of the survey were also impressed by the idea that certain countries should receive money, but that they have no sea or from the idea of funding requests for aid.
But these ideas came not from Brussels, but from Prague.
"We are at a disadvantage that we have no sea.
in the EU, we will apply for reimbursement, "he declared, in the autumn of 2004 the then Agriculture Minister Jaroslav Palas (čSsd).
The argument he gave was that the grain harvest was very high and the state were overcrowded camps as a result of the intervention purchases.
Another way because the Czech Republic to the ports, according to Palas, the EU should pay hundreds of millions of euros to us.
Finally, the European Commission, the Czech Republic so far forward that they organised a contract on the purchase of grain from countries, which have no access to the sea.
requests for financial aid provided the communities under the auspices of the Ministry of regional development minister Pavel NěMec (US-DEU), it has to be means for the establishment of were requests to Brussels.
EU: bizarre regulations are the exception
regulations in the member countries are easy targets for criticism, the efforts of the EU regulation and also to effectiveness and development for the whole of the European Union, deserves more recognition according to some experts.
These experts believe are a serious problem for the EU grants for projects which have absolutely nothing in common with the deepening of European integration, but in the budget negotiations have been imposed by individual member states.
emotions calls here also highlight the fact that the Czech Republic, like other member countries in Brussels must fight for the right to use specific names of traditional products and this fight not always wins.
The Czech Republic has been following a six-year battle with Germany and Austria, the name "Olomoucké TvarůžKy 'defend the national rum (Tuzemský rum), whose tradition dates back to the 19th century, but our manufacturers had to rename" TuzemáK ".
The name rum must only be used for products from sugar cane distil at, not for products from sugar beet.
The official list of registered products in the EU are in the society of the world-famous cheese, feta, gorgonzola, the LüBecker Marzipans or the famous Parma now the karlsbad Zwieback PohořElice and TřEboň, carp, or the Saazer hops.
with an EU trademark since the Pardubicer Lebkuchen or boasting of the HořIcer roles.
"I want the people that the Republic save, but I am just an amateur," said Okamura.
Senator, how is the idea, to run for the office of the President?
It is not about me, Senator or president.
If everything would work without problems in our country, I would get nowhere.
But I can no longer see the Republic being plundered for 20 years, as thieves are walking around freely, while people's taxes and increasing the retirement age.
I had no ambitions to be politicians.
But if I see something I do not like to propose a solution, then I try to change this.
And since I am over 40, independent and party, I have no other opportunity to influence things than to run for Senator or the President.
In the Senate, they have managed and then on the road to the castle.
Let it not your voters?
I have said all the time that I will take the fight to the castle after the outcome of the Senate elections in.
later clarified this and I said that I will run for the office of the President, if I am elected senator.
My aim is not the function. The function is a tool with which I can realise my vision.
For this, I need as much influence as possible and as a strong mandate.
But the problem is not only that we as a people in the pub and the television rant, but any order, want to change something.
the media want to deprive the honour and the freedom of speech and the freedom to lie.
I was claimed, for example, that journalists would bribe, or that I was Jiří Paroubek advisers.
We are talking about their vision.
The fight to have the Castle with the thesis of the material and criminal liability and with retrospective assets declarations by politicians over 20 million kroner.
You will have to change laws.
As President, you have no powers in this regard, and the Senate as a whole only legislative proposals.
How do you solve this problem?
as ordinary citizens, I argued that the tour guide is a free trade, and this could be enforced.
The problem is the small-minded policy-if someone from the right or the left is a good proposal is rejected, this deliberately, and considers the people only.
as an independent party-I have a much greater potential to gain support from all the parties represented in parliament.
My advantage is that I think without drawers and dogmas of each party can take what is best for our country.
do they see themselves as man in politics, more to the right or left?
I am from the Czech point of view, it seems to me that the people see more to the left.
But for me this right-left think is totally unimportant.
For me, it is important that we can make progress.
It is not a question of whether someone to the left or to the right-wing camp; I would unite the people.
I support publicly any good solution approach, even if this always comes from the KsčM or of the ODS, and I will oppose bad ideas.
It is not you, if someone described them as populists.
But they did not confirm what you have just said?
If you have a business plan in a company, then you are an ideal target and a vision.
and they want to be closer.
Can I call it populism, but all proposals, of which I have spoken, functioning in the world already, or they have been discussed by important experts.
But without support in parliament they just slogans.
and they are in politics not far in the long term.
or do you believe that you, when you talk only long enough with the people, we will be able, for example, the material and criminal liability?
I have no other option.
to convince politicians, journalists and the general public and to try to get them on our side, to achieve these objectives.
As President, it would be no problem for me, to call on the leaders of the parliamentary parties live on television, the material and criminal liability for politicians, officials, judges and prosecutors to enshrine in law.
and the raised would then say why they may reject it.
a strong personality, refers to maladministration can put pressure on the political scene.
You only need to look at the direct election of the president, which was a credit to the public pressure.
I would like to make it quite clear that I am an amateur; I am not a genius or an intellectual.
I am trying to find allies for my views and visions.
I have only just started with the policy and attempts to find the support of the majority, for my programme.
I always try to do things for themselves to judge; and if it does not work, then I am back in the private sector in six years.
The Czech Republic should save sounds a little, as if Okamura.
I am not a savior.
I know that I am hitting alone; I have spoken with several well-known personalities, whether or not you want to run for the Senate.
I have, for example, with Radim JančUra, but rejected because of overwork.
I also support the investigative journalist Jana Lorencová, which exposed the fraud in the trade with easy fuel oil.
my candidacy, I started with the premise that the people are deeply unhappy, but now I am not sure.
Sixty per cent of the electorate, have not gone to the elections have mostly gone, and the elected representatives of the establishment.
We are only two independent in the Senate.
The people who have elected Senate composition that changes will be very difficult to implement.
Nevertheless, I will fight for my vision, for example, for the direct election of mayors and district main men.
do you think about the creation of a separate party?
I have not thought about, because I have no time to review the past any potential party member, and certainly not the money.
I have not time money for the presidential campaign; at my transparent account only 20,000 Czk.
They have no money?
They speak of assets declarations, as would their?
I appreciate my private assets to about 60 million Czk.
In Prague, I have a property with a value of 25 million, a housing for about 10 million, a further 8 million, an art collection, which is worth around 10 million and an Aston Martin for 3.5 million and šKodu superb, worth around one million, and then I have a few million to the account.
The Aston Martin was a child's dream-James Bond always liked me, as it was in the car, Galant on women and, at the same time, fought against the evil.
They drive an Aston Martin have a capacity of 60 million and have no money for her campaign?
They say that they want to change the Republic, but you do not want to invest your own money.
This is not very convincing.
I have no 15 million for the campaign.
Should I make about debt?
I have already invested 2.5 million in the campaign.
The fact that I have no sponsors, shows that my programme is not too much interest.
and I am not committed to the campaign from its own resources.
The cost of the campaign will be basically covered by my salary as a senator.
But the senators content I could not live alone; I could, for example, my son not to finance the English school, the cost of 30,000 per month.
If I only wanted money, I would stand for nothing.
They are further work as entrepreneurs, in order to have their livelihoods?
They said that they will drive back these activities?
But this is not with the level of salary.
As promised, I cut my activities in part.
For example, my deputy director of travel agencies in the spring.
People want to see me as Good Samaritans, saving the Republic.
But I must also bit of life.
You were used as entrepreneurs in which monthly income?
Around 200,000 to 400,000 and that is still the case.
But as President I think businesses would stop.
The full conversation you find in the Saturday edition of Právo.
The Mvrdv architects to show not only that the real adventure in the head-on example of spijkenisse and the recently constructed books mountain-2 pictures
"I think the building fun, it looks much futuristic and, finally, there is something interesting to see," says Lisette Haig, a roadside Passantin.
and Stefan Spermon, it technicians in a nearby factories, says: "But, well, it is the house."
I wonder, however, what we still need a library.
all have the Internet, Ipad and e-books.
No one is yet in one of these old-style libraries, or on a voluntary basis?
spijkenisse, a little survey the most sleep city at the gates of Rotterdams is strange record.
The 80,000 residents, community education has the lowest rate in the Netherlands.
in order to counteract this stupid situation, we decided a few years ago, contributing to the general and the seven fictional bridges to emulate the euro notes are presented as nicely Bepinselte reinforced concrete Miniaturen.
The success of the offensive was limited.
and so, the city fathers, recognized that there is only one way, should the statistics: a library.
The Rotterdam architecture office Mvrdv Winy Maas, a master of foolhardy beam charts and producer of Witzigen, often cynical buildings, took up the cause with his usual calm and appeared for the competition-hearing in 2003 with five books at the poor and a grin on your face.
and while the jury looked Verdutzt and with the Achseln Zuckte Stapelte the impudent maas his splendid Mitbringsel ended according to the size of a pyramid and its Aktionistisch founded speech with the words: "Love city community!"
It is, therefore, my proposal for the books mountain of spijkenisse, for the so-called Boeke Mountain.
Nine years later, the EUR 30 million expensive mountain excavated sites.
It is also part of a revitalization project, to the underground car park, supermarket, post office, and a few neighboring residential and row houses with a total of 50 homes.
At the beginning of November, the books Mountain with the second prize was awarded "Best library of NL 2012 '.
The project is also nominated for the Dutch national wood award 2012.
The faceless town is a test-tube, yet had more to offer than a post-modern pedestrian zone and a stunned ugly town hall, whose white facades would be inclined to suspect a dairy factory, a piece of contemporary architecture richer.
But above all spijkenisse now has on the first public culture construction in the history of his existence.
The Long Road to the book
The first impression: books El Dorado under glass.
There is a lift to the middle through mountain massive, but the real space open and read delights the foot gap to climb the topography.
The fully Verglaste Atrium is bright and clear, the gun Klinker soil and the elegant city lights clearly speak the language of a public square.
The urban atmosphere is perfect.
It has already looking for parking, dog and football-playing boys and bank MäDels.
and books, books, books everywhere.
"Normally the books shelves along the façade, and in the middle is a large, dark space usually get unpleasant and impersonal way," says Winy maas.
We have read the classic room configuration to the head and the field of Interior externally imposed.
The mountain is shrewdly: Home of the books in the middle are offices, Internet library, chess club, environment technology centre and house key.
A particular pleasure, the black book shelves, the time BrüStung wall window dressing, time, time rose close countries.
optics Haptik and smell are foreign.
even die-hard shake architects and construction engineers whether the unknown building substance the head.
"We wanted to work with recycling materials here," says Joop Trouborst, project manager at the city municipality spijkenisse, at the request of the standard.
and we are in a FriesläNdischen agricultural company a day on an appropriate waste product from agriculture.
For many years in the Netherlands used in greenhouses and fields a fraction of thin plastic fleece a source document.
The time is cheap and efficient.
The slender textile considers two Saisonen, then it is ready for the non-proliferation.
The library was the fleece-for the first time in these quantities pressed four-inch thick plates.
under heat exposure and pressure VerfäRbt the so-called Landbouwplastic (Klp) to a dark, homogenous, burden-material, Bissl sport shoe after new cars and a Bissl smell.
After 105 stages is reached at the summit.
At the end of the nearly 500 metres long travels in literature café will not only with a fantastic prospect of the city, but also with Dutch Kroketten and Eingetopften rewarded ficus trees.
They ensure atmosphere, but above all for the right humidity in the literature in the mountains.
donations for the new soul
"It would be not to believe, but this house is a flagship project in terms of ecology," says despite the many glass land Trouborst.
There will be heated and cooled with geothermal energy.
Although the books under a glass mountain fall, the Sun even on sunny days only briefly to home.
The broad wood glue binder across the glass façade, serve as Beschattung and catch a large part of the Sun.
The room climate is very pleasant.
The rest fully automated Rollos.
Stefan Spermon dared, the initial skeptics from the IT industry, already leading the way in the new library.
Lisette because the Haig was already.
and also the TCM-teacher Cynthia Bogarde, Boeke mountain even Spijkenisses "long overdue soul."
The reason: to open a few weeks ago, any residents invited to donate a book from his personal stock.
should start the optical gaps in the still not fully-stocked library-currently 70 piece-filled.
The concept is deployed.
the shelves are filled to the top.
"There is nothing worse than a half-empty library," says architect Winy maas.
"I think now, thanks to our invitation to all inhabitants of a certain relationship with this new house.
Everyone knows that his book is part of this building.
and if it is only to grace.
In doing so, Mvrdv those accepted managed, in the jargon called identity.
spijkenisse wrote literary history.
They may be so young and uneducated.
It is high time that this is a starting point for identity.
Szabo: "German must play greater role '
Germany, which abstained in the vote on the opening of Palestine.
According to Stephen Szabo, an expert on US-European relations, balanced Berlin on a fine diplomatic line.
German wave: the beginning of the week, Germany had first indicated that it opposed the request for observer status for the Palestinians at the United Nations.
But then the Berlin abstained.
Why not?
Stephen Szabo: Germany supports what the Israelis have done in Gaza.
now Germany because of its special relationship with Israel must be cautious, however.
But, at the same time, I believe that it is also not supported the American position.
Germany wanted to demonstrate its independence, without having to be too critical of Israel.
During the uprising in Libya in March 2011, Germany also abstained when it came to setting up a no-fly zone.
This has finally been enforced by the NATO.
Germany is finding it difficult to adopt a clear position on important international issues?
Yes, that is true.
This is due to the fact that surrounded his foreign policy and away from a policy was pay, so to speak, of the United States, to a German foreign policy.
This is compounded by the fact that the Europeans have no coherent and uniform policy.
The Germans find themselves between the fronts.
It is expected that a more independent role, but they are not used.
I think you buttons to their role, but they are on the path to a more "normal" foreign policy.
A foreign policy, like France or Britain.
What is a 'normal' foreign policy, specifically from a German point of view?
It shows the willingness, in positions of national interests, which are independent from those of the United States or European partners.
I believe that the German foreign policy is motivated by the economic policy of exports and its relations to certain regions, such as Russia, China or the Middle East.
Germany's economic interests are to a certain extent, unlike the other major powers and why Germany must protect its interests.
These economic interests have influence on the position of the conflict in the Middle East and the vote in the UN?
Germany has large markets in the Middle East, particularly in the Gulf states.
Therefore, it must be careful to the public, but also the elites, not to offend in the Arab countries.
It plays a role in any case.
But I would also not want to attach much weight to, this is not a totally one-sided relationship.
In any case, but it plays an important role in German thinking.
Germany has its relations with the United States damaged by it has abstained from voting on important decisions, such as on the vote on Palestine?
I believe in Europe, and even in the United States, there is a great deal of sympathy for the German position.
I do not think, therefore, that this was such a dramatic collapse, as in the Libyan issue.
maybe Germany will play even a certain respect.
because it signals that it must be taken into account as an international player to be taken seriously and its interests.
There are different views in Europe to the Palestinian initiative.
The United States, on the other hand have been clear for a veto.
There are differences between the United States and many European nations?
because the American domestic politics, these differences have always existed.
I believe that the Obama administration has secretly quite a lot of sympathy for the European position.
But because of the political situation here, the government can not represented this position publicly, of course.
I believe that the real differences are not so great as they seem.
If you look at the relationship between Obama and Prime Minister Netanyahu, then it is Obama, not so upbeat of Netanyahu's policy.
Germany is finding it difficult, his close relations with Israel and the United States, on the one hand, and the position of the most important partners in the EU, on the other side?
I believe that this is what makes it so difficult for the Germans.
It would, of course, be a bit easier for the Germans, if there is a coherent and unified European policy, which is not the case at the moment.
so you can not be part of a wider line and must instead things from their own position.
that they do so with the euro.
I believe that Germany will play a leading role in the future, to press Europe to a European position.
It is not easy for Germany, because of the relationship with Israel.
This has always been a sensitive issue.
I believe, however, that the German, it is clear that they must play a more independent role.
Germany to see itself in the role as an important international players-Germany wants to play a major role?
or is the lead Germany still difficult?
Germany is not used, it is always uncomfortable and, for obvious reasons, it is still difficult for the country, to play a greater role.
For example, if we look at the Euro crisis, every time when Germany assumes a greater role, various anti-German sentiment.
that makes it the German is not easy.
This is, in fact, the old problem: you do not be surrounded by hostile countries.
So Germany is in a more difficult position than the United States.
It must be sensitive to various neighbours and opinions, and that is not easy.
Now, the influence of the United States in the European policy continues, the EU does not fill this vacuum at the moment but who remains otherwise?
The Germans will simply need to play a greater role.
Even if you do not like it is inconvenient for them and they will be much less popular, c'Est la vie.

"brand protection" in China: If Puma and an Armani suddenly Chinese.
an Armani is also a world-renowned brand, Polo Ralph Lauren.
But what is an Armani Polo?
behind it is a very officially registered in China, but has nothing to do with the companies.
However, it enjoys protection, as long as the actual name donors did not complain.
and even then, it is not clear whether they are right.
"It will be increasingly difficult for foreigners to protect their trademarks in China," says Thomas Pattloch, a lawyer in the firm Taylor Wessing, specialising in protection of rights violations in the far east.
Every week, a new case ends up on my desk.
the clones are a few extra letters so that they can register their trademarks.
So Gucci simply Lu-Gucci, Prada, Prada-Kny.
German companies will also be legally copied in this way, the sports goods manufacturers Puma.
stalemate hole opens up a raft of registering the trademarks Bureau in Beijing.
On 14 September 2010, a Chinese company that protect trademarks Zegna DF puma, an art, and also in the fashion house Ermenegildo Zegna.
The Chinese world champion injured in copy and intellectual property, is well known.
In the big cities there is MehrstöCkige department stores sell almost exclusively counterfeiting.
But the stalemate hole cases are different: on behalf of his client, it is that Chinese companies are the trademarks Agency officially receive the right to use a name that is already protected elsewhere.
The Chinese call the "bang Ming Pai, a passenger brand.
Based on the floor "bang Dakuan."
So are women, rich men angling.
The Chinese authorities are aware of any blame
"It is bad for business, it must combat 'calls for stalemate hole.
"The brand will be watered down, the position alone, the damage is enormous."
The cost of financial losses and the process of the industries affected are in the millions, especially in expensive flagship products.
According to the market research society CLSA China with a volume of 15 billion euros in the year of the third largest market for luxury goods and is the fastest growing.
But erased dubious entries in the register trademarks are difficult to achieve and go into money.
up to nine years, the process can drag on, with uncertain results.
Pattloch reported cases in which the court authorities because, after the long duration of the reported name to "market had become reality."
If the plaintiff misfortune, must pay the Plagiator even money because he injured, says stalemate hole its brand in China.
Sometimes, there is the law of the jungle.
famous cases relate to graphic elements.
2009 Daimler lost a legal battle with the construction machinery manufacturer Sany, that company, which recently took over the German concrete pump Bauer putzmeister.
To date, the Chinese must therefore use a symbol that resembles the Mercedes star.
The Volvo-buyer Geely, originally used a blue and white logo, BMW recalled; the dispute was resolved, Geely had to change it.
The Lacoste fashion manufacturers lost against counterfeiters in China from Hong Kong and Singapore, the famous crocodile look in the other direction.
The Chinese authorities are aware of any blame.
the trademarks agency Ctmo in Beijing is that there are bottlenecks 2010 due to lower personnel and facilities.
Last year, however, one of the "emergency situation in business returned to normal life."
So is the Unbearbeiteter appeals procedure was about 22 percent.
57, 000 such cases have been completed, almost 75 per cent more than in the previous year.
However, still 81.500 appeals in the office waiting for execution.
It costs a lot
As so often in China, the numbers are impressive.
Last year the Ctmo more than 1.4 million applications for trademark protection, almost a third more than 2010.
This is a record and China means that for the tenth consecutive year, the list of new applications in all the world, shares the authority.
that also applies to the stock of all valid trademark, a total of 5.5 million head.
In 2011, had been taken 1.8 billion yuan in fees.
On average, means that any registration simplified 1280 yuan or costs EUR 160.
It costs a lot, as the case of the German family company freudenberg.
for more than seven years, the company has been struggling against a Chinese Plagiator.
Although the German could achieve that its illegal manufacture of imitation of motor vehicle parts was unearthed.
But secured the freudenberg followers continue the Chinese rights to the brand.
We have failed in this, as in Germany, family names could not be protected, says Hanno Wentzler, chairman of the board of freudenberg chemical specialities in Munich.
the trademarks agency Ctmo rejected the objection of the Munich back.
In the next two bodies, freudenberg, opponents of the law, but the process is continuing until today.
You must watch your step
now the matter is pending before the Supreme Court.
Wentzler is confident to bring the matter to a successful conclusion, and praises the professionalism of the courts.
But he also says: "The process is extremely expensive, and it costs us a lot of time, money and nerves."
The internal costs could hardly figures the company archives have even one hundred years old need to look through files in order to provide evidence.
Five years ago, freudenberg offered the opposition a "high six-digit code amounts" to settlement in vain.
"That shows how much we value," says Wentzler.
The dangers in the Far East to places even after Europe.
that is, if there imitators vulnerable brands.
It was a Chinese manufacturers in Germany the name freudenberg for shoes and leather.
However, this business has abandoned the company long, he could avert the registration.
"You must watch your step," says Wentzler.
Both he and the lawyer Pattloch rates German companies to be very careful in doing business with China.
It is not enough to rely on international trade mark rights, much more should the foreigners "somehow everything is worth protecting, also registered in China," as Wentzler says.
Otherwise, can be much more expensive than the registration.
In fact, if freudenberg in the last act of his trademark drama is governed, then it is the other side pay royalties on their own behalf, Wentzler.
or, in the segment in question, we will be squeezed out of the market.
World AIDS Day: scratch, help
in Heidelberg Probt the chorus Imbongi-and in Swaziland are delighted children orphaned by AIDS.
The story of a relationship far more than overcomes 8733 kilometres.
First, there is the scratch: Cowboy boots, basketball shoes, ladies pumps and gentlemen look slipper on the dance floor ground stroke, it quickly.
one-two-three-four.
then thresholds, the voices of the singer slowly-old bass, tenor and Sopran-press, things and follow.
and fiete hopf, the 29-year-old conductor, it almost from its substance shoes if he brings together with its Geschmeidig wild gestures.
It is Monday evening, in the music room of the institute for medical psychology in Heidelberg Probt the chorus Imbongi a new song.
of the 50 singer and singer came between 23 and 69 years old, by the human genetics, Erin to the householder.
"Om Obani" is not an easy piece, every chorus voice has a different text and also in a foreign language: Zulu, the eleven million people in South Africa, Botswana, Lesotho, Malawi, Mozambique and parts of Swaziland.
helping people to help themselves
Worldwide, there are around 34 million HIV-infected, UNAIDS estimates, the sound of the United Nations AIDS programme.
23.5 million people living in South Africa.
245000 AIDS orphans live in Swaziland.
More than 40% of the population are now HIV-positive.
for 180 children orphaned by AIDS in the village of Esitjeni has found the club voices for Africa godfathers in Germany.
70 of them attend secondary school.
for 15 or 20 euros a month, you can take a sponsor.
It guarantees the child school fees, uniforms and a warm meal on GoGo-center every day.
Imbongi means Zulu history story-teller or praise Preiser.
fluent in the Bantu language anyone in this area, but can sing.
for almost ten years is the chorus songs in this foreign soft language and brings it back then, and to where they originally come from: in South Africa.
8 733 kilometres of Heidelberg as the crow flies, there is the village in the north of the kingdom of Swaziland, Esitjeni depends on the voting power of the German chores.
Forty percent are infected
about 2000 people live there, some still in simple Lehm- and straw huts, a large part of them are children.
More than 300 of them no longer have parents, because they are succumbed to the Hi-virus.
Swaziland suffers in Esitjeni shows in small what: highest HIV infection rate, lowest life expectancy in the world, according to UNICEF.
circumcision of male skin, the risk of contagion has cut by half, will be accepted by the population of barely.
more than 40 per cent of people in Swaziland, the immunodeficiency virus, with mid-30 to die is not uncommon.
In a joint Africa trip in the spring of 2005, the choir of the village, but above all, Imbongis many children were on the streets, which not only lack of parental care, but simply of everything: food, clothes, education.
without school, only right in a poor country has no chance.
Initially, it was the private individual commitment for a few euros a year to send a child to school and to allow him a warm meal a day.
But a year later was the chorus of the Association "voices for Africa", since almost professionally about AIDS orphans in Esitjeni.
facts to sexually transmitted infections
What are the main sexually transmitted diseases?
Among the bacterial STI syphilis, Chlamydia and tripper (Gonorrhö).
frequent viral STI are humane Pappilomaviren HIV, herpes Genitalis or hepatitis.
Web lice and KräTze belong to the parasite STI.
who are the main stakeholders?
syphilis and tripper come mainly in men who have sex with men.
The Robert-Koch Institute assumes that at least four of the five all in Germany reported syphilis cases transmitted by sexual contact between men.
In the heterosexual adults are chlamydia infections, Trichomonaden Candidose (mushroom), tripper and humane Pappilomaviren often common sexually transmitted diseases.
The spread of HIV among heterosexual adults here is comparatively low, however: around 20% of new HIV infections in this group.
Chlamydia infections are among young people much more frequently than other population groups.
European surveys three-quarters of all infections young people between 15 and 25 years.
here also come humane Pappilomaviren often in young people.
As the number of infections has developed?
not all sexually transmitted diseases are reporting obligation.
The number of syphilis infections, according to the Robert-Koch Institute of 1697 disease in 2001 to 3698 disease more than doubled in 2011.
Since 2007, the number of new HIV infections is back.
In 2011, there were around 2 700 cases.
that is around a tenth less than in the previous year.
What symptoms pointing to a sex disease?
The infectious diseases can urinate, outflows, stomach and ulcers in the genital area, complaints to the BläSchen or Warzen.
But often they cause no pain or other symptoms and therefore remain unnoticed.
How can we protect themselves?
condoms can reduce the risk of infection, but does not provide 100% protection.
On the part of pathogens of sexually transmitted diseases can also be passed on by smear infection and close body contact.
Above all, experts recommend regular examinations in frequently changing sex partners.
early diagnosed most STI cured and repercussions can be avoided.
Godmothers, donations and, last but not least, the ', which the choir in Germany Ersingt, some.
"Overall, we have around 200 000 euros after Esitjeni sent," says Annette Lennartz, chairman of the Association.
In the village of self-administered Zodwa Dlamini, a self-confident and assertive woman, the money from Germany.
It is also important that the orphans under, one of the grandmothers.
The Gogos, as the old women in Zulu, are the mainstays of the village.
Some of them have up to 14 orphans included, giving them a roof over their head and ensure that the children in their uniforms every day getting to school.
Anyone who has any more, comes into Khanyisile protection house, a single woman, being paid by the Club in the same way as the two cooks, the every day for more than 200 hungry children.
"voices for Africa" has also launched a NäHschule, two chicken houses are being built and organized jointly with the American Health Organization PSI that many in the village have an HIV test.
It is not obvious, because obviously the disease across the country, it is silent, preferably dead.
a king with 14 wives
"AIDS is an absolute taboo," says Annette Lennartz, "because it has to do with sexuality."
strange in a country in which the king officially 14 wives.
The last absolute monarch, King Mswati III, Africa's black is known for his excessive lifestyle.
Polygamy rather than democracy.
Among other things, it is also due to this state-sanctioned way of life that the Hi-virus has spread so quickly in the past decades.
but also the many migrant workers, the virus around the country.
Free condoms there in every corner, says Annette Lennartz, 'but they are hardly used.
The culture is an other-flesh to flesh. "
In order to promote the cultural exchange, the Imbongi-chorus every two or three years jointly by the South Africa and sings songs full of nostalgia, fighting spirit, confidence and black self-confidence, many on the southern bit of the black continent of apartheid.
A bus full of white, sing the songs in a black tongue-recognition not only mood and so much joy, but also has some fierce border guards a few tears Abgetrotzt.
The trip is also to visit their godchildren Esitjeni, where the singer.
Even if the small village on maps hardly, in the Valley of Ezulweni River is more than known.
"After Esitjeni, there is the light," say the people there.
and if the 8733 kilometres after Heidelberg returns as the crow flies, the Stampfenden singers in the test area of Bergheimer road, then we see it also as lights.
Messenger: NASA found ice on mercury
The probe Messenger has found evidence that there is on the planet Mercury ice.
The ice cover is perhaps up to 20 metres thick.
The US space agency NASA has proven the existence of ice on the planet Mercury.
Although he is closest to the sun, there are some frozen water from three studies published Thursday in the specialist magazine "Science".
The probe messenger have found evidence that the ice is constantly in the shadow of the region of the planet.
This should be at least 30 centimeters, and perhaps even up to 20 metres thick.
The water probably came from comets or Asteroids on the mercury may be taken.
But no one does the discovery of ice with the existence of life on the planet, said the chief scientist Sean Solomon, Messenger-probe,.
The temperature on the Mercury can reach up to 426 degrees Celsius.
But the findings could help to clarify how the water and other building blocks of life in other parts of the solar system.

Our insights into space: The main Teleskope
The telescope will be Hans Lipperhey invented 1608-even before Galileo Galilei began to observe stars on it a year later.
Since then, the mirror of the optical Teleskope increasing-and the insight they provide deeper.
For 30 years, from 1947 until 1975, the Hale telescope at the palomar observatory near San Diego was the world's largest long-distance pipe.
The Mirror, here in the picture, had an average of five metres.
in Arizona, the United States, the large binocular telescope.
It can look into space on two levels, each with a diameter of 8.4 metres.
the inner workings of the Gran Telescopio Canarias on the Canary Island of La Palma is huge-alone the mirror is 10.4 meters in diameter.
the mirror of the southern African large telescope in southern Africa is segmented-in order to save costs.
Nevertheless it has a diameter of about 11 metres.
The disadvantage of good design: the telescope is in his corner of here-and so in limited his mobility.
The hobby-Eberly telescope in Texas is in view.
its characteristic: the high light collection force.
This is despite comparatively low mirror diameter, to the world's largest mirror Teleskope.
With the help of a radio telescope at arecibo (Puerto Rico) hear researchers all aliens signals.
The radio telescope has a diameter of 305 metres.
In the "search for extraterrestrial intelligence (Seti) anyone can help by computer owners he would available.
Look at the Observatory of European Sternwarte (ESO) in the Chilean Andes.
Here is the very large telescope-worthy of its name.
with its four lights from the distance pipe can also reflect the medium-sized infrared spectrum.
Also on the Chilean ESO Observatory will be the European extremely large telescope.
Its main mirror will include hefty 42 metres-and almost a thousand mirror elements.
But with images is 2018 at the earliest.
By 2007, were the two Keck-Teleskope in the Hawaiian root volcano Mauna Kea, as the largest in the world.
They offer two levels, with an average of 10 metres.
the Keck-Teleskope are part of Mauna Kea Observatory, among them with the Subaru telescope and the Irttf looking towards the sky.
Also on Mauna Kea, a new, huge telescope-- an average of 30 metres with a mirror.
It is an illustration to gaze at.
However, the most important impressions from the provides all the space telescope Hubble.
Since the 24 April 1990 it already provides images of distant worlds.
Since March 2009, the space telescope Kepler is looking for extra-solar planet-mainly in the countryside.
On 2 February 2011 was announced by NASA that identified 1235 planet candidates since the mission began.
In the picture are the last start preparations on the space telescope Kepler documented.
The James Webb space telescope (Jwst), 2018 at the earliest on board a Ariane5 rocket shot into space.
The space infrared telescope's primary mirror has a diameter of 6.5 metres.
One of the tasks of the telescope: it should seek the light from the first stars and galaxies after the Big Bang.
Scientists assume that also exists on the south pole of the Mercury ice.
However, there is no reliable data, because underpins the messenger far closer to the North Pole for the planet.
For decades, have radar measurements suggest that the Mercury ice.
By 2004, Messenger-tube-launched the first, which underpins the mercury-the scientists have now certainty.

A search for traces in the country, are still relatively young in the 97-year-old.
The journey through the Talysch mountains is wild romantic.
The small bus Rumpelt rich on the curve of the road in the past, farmers sell rivers and simple houses in densely wooded hills.
everything is green and Saftig, one might think it would have been in the black forest.
But this is the deep south of Azerbaijan, the border with Iran is just a few kilometres away.
Here, the Caucasian ethnic Talyschen, not much is known, except that she speaks perfect Persian and Aserisch and very durable.
terminus is Lerik.
The small city flaunts Wuchtig Geratener architecture from Soviet times, which is not in the picturesque mountain landscape.
tourists come from Europe is hardly onerous here to the journey of Azerbaijan's capital Baku.
The 323 km you need eight hours, because the road is only one-sided.
The incredible wealth, the country owes its oil in the Caspian Sea, is still not arrived here in the province.
But Pilata Fatulayeva (48) is convinced that Lerik the stuff to tourist attraction.
"Baku became famous with the Eurovision Song Festival in May next year-and here we have a festival of the oldest people in the world," says Fatulayeva.
It is the director of the museum, the only one in the world for longevity.
This is the time you spent about eight dozen documented more than 100 Fatulayeva Talyschen from the area shows a black-and-white photograph.
This is my grandfather, he was 120 years old.
in 136 years of age a child conceived
But the museum is the controversial star shepherd şIrali MüSlüMov, the 168-year-old should be.
However, there is a birth certificate.
and, in the light of the oldest documented people, of the 122 years old has been, MüSlüMovs age seems extremely doubtful.
"1805 he was born here in the region, he died in 1973," explained Fatulayeva.
The man was married three times and had 23 children, in the age of 136 years, he conceived a daughter.
şIrali MüSlüMov so his age by a few decades?
But Rembrandt Scholz, age, researchers at the Max Planck Institute in Rostock, has heard of the elderly in Central Asia.
"Many Hochaltrige people, there are also striking in some areas of China, Japan or the hunza Valley in Pakistan," says Scholz, "also in Sardinia life extremely many very old men."
However, due to the lack of documents is not scientific proof of age, since register were missing.
Every day, bowl Geschmolzene butter
The fact is, though, that the people of the region around Lerik remarkably often Biblisches age.
There are currently 20 people older than 100 years.
So why live here in the south so many high elderly?
The Azeri tour guide Farid Mugimzadeh explains Talyschen with special genes.
Museum Director Fatulayeva, in contrast, believes that the food.
But that should be the calorie-rich diet of Talyschen as healthy, love meat, bread and above all milk products and many of whom drink a glass of Geschmolzene butter every day, not just from a nutritional point of view seems plausible.
or is it the original way of life that keeps people young? In Cengemiran, a tiny settlement near the city of Lerik, Rubaba Mirzayeva.
with its 97 years for this broad still comparatively young.
Mirzayeva, which claims to have 143 descendants, live in a simple wooden house, which is typical for the whole of the Caucasus region.
it is sitting on the ground with a butter barrel they tirelessly rolls out back and forth.
Eight people live here under one roof, including one from Mirzayevas sons and a daughter, both are grandparents.
two small children jumping around.
In the kitchen, we are preparing the guests tea, in the typical, gut dip served poor Adu-glasses.
Mirzayevas white teeth are perfect in Reih and link, hiding under her headscarf you long, dark skinned ZöPfe before US reveals proud of her son.
I always have my hair with milk washed, so they never me and kept their colour.
I also never used "shampoo," says Mirzayeva.
monthly pension is enough for life
It has only ever eaten, which came from their own farm, tomatoes, potatoes, peas.
my whole life I have not bought a single time in supermarket food.
They then told by her husband, who was in the army.
It was worst in the period following the Second World War.
But everything was better than the "beloved father Heydar Aliyew took the helm.
The propaganda sounds strange from the mouth of an old woman.
But the cult of the father of the nation, ruled the country as a dictator, knows no borders in Azerbaijan.
by 2003 he was in power, and later his son Ilham took the helm.
After all, there are no emergency Azerbaijan old.
230 Manat (Mirzayeva receives approximately the same amount in euros) a month as a pension, an amount for local conditions, we can live well.
and perhaps Mirzayevas has long Ergrauter son is right: "The old enjoy high respect in our culture."
They live in the midst of the extended family, loved, cared for and are happy.
If that is not a reason to stay alive as long as possible
The word "lack of human rights" in the constitution.
The revolution is returned to Cairo.
rival demonstrations in Cairo reveal the deep divisions in the country.
the future constitution with Sharia law as the basis is controversial.
The Egyptian President segment with emotion.
We must create the transition.
"and that he will succeed is my responsibility before the people and before God," he said on state television.
His speech was addressed to the whole nation, but above all to the Christian Copts, the liberal, enlightened Muslims and secular.
They have all been hopelessly divided in a confused opposition, fear.
fear of a theocracy on the Nile of grace of the powerful Muslim Brotherhood.
He said Mohammed Mursi almost Entschuldigend, limit the powers of the Constitutional Court temporarily and expanded its powers, "in order to save the revolution."
But what of the 61-year-old engineer, a PhD of the American University of Southern California, really want to save, the Egyptians, the world is not entirely in the clear.
The judiciary should be ousted?
In fact, the 234 articles, as in the 100-member of the Islamist-dominated constituent assembly pushed through a night, 15-hour Parforce ride, some were worrying.
As in previous constitutions also stated in the draft law reasons on the "principles of Islamic law".
But what does "principles"?
This was and is open to interpretation and it is to be feared that the vague wording and the associated legal room for the Islamists will use a stricter interpretation of Sharia law.
that suggests at least a new managed Article: Sharia law in all matters relating to the Al-ashar University on this point, the most important Islamic institution of the country with great power in the entire Sunni Islam.
This must not, however, it may mean that the clergy supervised the legislation, which would lead to the de facto disenfranchisement of the Judiciary.
Much of the Verfassunsgsentwurf is open to interpretation
problematic: the civil military jurisdiction should also continue to be maintained.
These courts served during Mubarak's rule to suppress the opposition.
After the fall of the dictator were up to 11,000 civilians in military detention.
The state should also, as it says in the draft, "the true nature of the Egyptian family" protect "and promote their morals and values."
This is legally vague terms that even state institutions, with the help of this article could control the content of film art and literature.
in plain language, this means nothing other than censorship.
Moreover, no article stipulates expressly the equality between men and women.
For another, prohibits the Prophet Mohammed and his envoy to insult or to slander.
But what an insult is and how it should be punished, remains unclear.
also questionable is the wording to "insult to the people" is banned.
There has been a caricature of the president or a joke at the expense of a leader?
interpretation, as much in the draft to sign, Mursi and his words will be presented "very soon" the Egyptians on the referendum.
"The revolution is Back '
The opposition is taking shape for weeks against the power of the Islamists.
Tens of thousands gathered in unaccustomed harmony in Tahrir square in Cairo on Friday night and promised to bring the charter before it can enter into force.
"The revolution is back and we will win," said Hamdin Sabbahi Drittplatzierter of presidential elections.
The Nobel peace prize laureate and former head of the International Atomic Energy Agency, Mohamed El-Baradei said, the draft constitution "on the scrapheap of history."
He accused the supporters Mursis via text messaging service twitter, a "coup against democracy".
"If the referendum, we will go to his palace and pounce," the opposition said Jasser said.
"We are still not tired of the blood of our brothers is still not arrested," the Egyptian media quoted the opposition politicians Chaled Ali.
and several judges announced that the referendum would not want to monitor, which will become invalid.
"The Koran is our constitution"
For its part, the well-organized Muslim Brotherhood inflated to counter demonstration, as a precaution after a mass prayer, but not in Tahrir Square, but on the other Nile Bank of Cairo University.
Many of the veiled women and supporters of the Salafists attended and chanted: "the people demand the application of God's law."
They demanded Mursi, "SäUbere!" and made the country: "The Koran is our constitution."
A fight for sovereignty over the symbolic Tahrir Square, where everything began, would probably have led to civil war conditions.
The Mursis supporters obviously did not want to risk that.
The Muslim Brotherhood said both the opponents of the draft constitution and the supporters have spoken loud and clear.
Now is the time to let the people to decide through the ballot box, in which direction the country should go.
A majority of the Islamists is safe.
"Human rights is not even the word '
Hafez Abu Saeda is angry about this forced constitutional process, until February and involve all social forces have gone.
The 48-year-old human rights lawyer and Chairman of the Egyptian Organization for Human Rights (EOHR) defended the Muslim Brotherhood, as they were in prison or on trial under Mubarak.
not because he would share their beliefs, but because human rights are indivisible.
He was beaten, convicted, imprisoned.
"and now is not the word 'human rights in the new constitution," he complains in conversation with the "world" on Sunday.
Mursi power extension to all three branches in the state's lawyer resign.
These measures are blatant violations of the democratic rules of the game and will lead Egypt into a new dictatorship.
"rather than to strengthen civil society, the president they de facto no force," laments Saeda.
But without civil society organisations could not function a democracy.
Saeda feels abandoned by the international community to fight the ideological direction of the Nile with a mixture of curiosity and excitement.
This could backfire.
a protestor in the Tahrir warns: "Your GebäHrt a monster, you can no longer control."
Rakfisk from Norway: is this the üBelriechendste fish in the world?
Norway's five million inhabitants enjoy one of the highest living standards-and not only in Europe but throughout the world.
The secret of the success of the country could have something to do with the local appetite for quite evil smelling fish?
take a selection on mature cheeses.
Platziere you in the midst of a crowd of dirty, more humid sports clothing.
and leave it there for a week.
that we must imagine the NasenbetäUbenden smell of Rak Fisk, one of the most delicate of Norway.
I am in the small town of fagernes, about three hours from Oslo.
There is snow, spectacular landscapes-and this persistent smell in the air, simply will not disappear.
Rakfisk is best reute trout with salt-depending on how Stinkend his fish would like-to up to a year in water ferments.
When the darkness in Norway about the country and the weather is colder, Norwegians to a celebration here in fagernes, this now really very Bestechenden speciality.
"you eat it raw and SpüLt it down with a glass of Aquavit, 'says Havard Halv arsenic, working in the local fire station, but as the so-called" Rak Fisk-General', also held the festival.
small fish eat people around us and decided to take large quantities of alcohol.
"It was people like the Aquavit more than the Rak Fisk," says Havard.
The spirit can crowd out the smell.
I tried some chunks.
If it avoids the Rak Fisk in general vicinity, it is not bad-such as sushi, which has a long bus ride.
Rak Fisk is the product of a very different, much poorer Norwegian era, when there were no cold and wet fish in the air dense salt water barrels in the autumn.
in deepest winter, he was then removed after a long fermentation and subdued end-- no doubt with the help of alcohol consumed.
Even a generation ago saw thousands of Norwegians on the forced to leave their country in search of work and decreased mainly in the United States.
Today, the population is growing rapidly-more than 13% are immigrants, attracted by a thriving job market, high wages and a comprehensive health care.
Even from Sweden, the old rivals, not too long ago was much richer than Norway, flows of immigrants.
Rakfisk is seen as something important-as a vital, if strictly Riechender part of Norwegian history.
He is one of the more expensive courts, which you can buy here.
However, everything here is really expensive-a small glass of beer or a sandwich costs EUR 10 proud.
Norway does not often in the press, and the most people seems not to interfere.
Still, Anders Breivik hates it name-the racist right-wing extremists last year 77 men, women and children shot.
Instead, refers only to the "incident on 22 July."
Norwegians find it difficult to accept that someone is capable of such brutal murders in their peace-loving country.
the main responsibility for today's wealth of Norway since the early 1970's, growth is one of the largest oil and gas industries in the world.
"But oil is not the only reason why we are so well off," says Anna, our waitresses, the round Tabletts mature Rak Fisk, distributed and enthuse people with her long blond hair, and embodies the Stechend blue eyes of the Nordic ideal.
We are, as they say, sensible people.
their English is exactly as the most people here impeccable.
We are not very Angeberisch, we may not boasting.
Norway is very careful with its oil wealth-a large part of the industry profits will be invested in a special fund for the benefit of future generations.
in the years leading up to the world economic crisis, all with money raised, that they had not considered Norway closed its purse.
"As long as we can go go go skiing in winter and in summer, we are happy," says Anna.
"and, of course, RAK Fisk to eat," she adds with Unbeschwertem laugh.
I am in the snow and am I have enough for another court-Rak Fisk.
In any case, so an Elk Burger is something else. enjoy the juicy meat.
But the evening is the Stinke fish on the menu.
The hotel, in the event I Logiere is one of several places a Rakfisk organise dinner where guests for the best-- or perhaps the most challenging fish smell sense can vote.
There is a live-TV line to a fly shirted Showmaster, surrounded by tables with RAK Fisk.
The spectacle is similar to the Eurovision Song Contest.
"What marks you up there in the mountains for the best fish, Thor-Jürgen?"
"here are our points, Havard."
We note and laughs.
A man is overwhelmed by his seat, possibly of Aquavit.
But perhaps it is the strict cloud of whole fish.
Mexico's Enrique Pena Nieto faces difficult start
while Mexico's president-elect Enrique Pena Nieto prepared for his arrival, analysed by the BBC wants to grant the challenges and the mixed feelings of its people.
Transport is currently in Mexico City is particularly bad.
Even in better days, this is a city always clogged a ring of steel has been built, but on Monday, blocking several major transport routes into the capital and causing havoc on the roads.
However, it was not intended to disrupt commuters on their way to work, but to prevent demonstrators from the parliament.
On Saturday, Mexico's new President Enrique Pena Nieto received the President of cement and the leadership of the nation.
It is a complex task.
Under the outgoing government of Felipe Calderon, Mexico can prove economically well, but the country is in the grip of a drug war, which has claimed 60,000 lives in the past six years.
"My government is strongly committed to reduce the violence," said Pena Nieto earlier this week the US President Barack Obama in the Oval Office.
I will propose a new security strategy, we can achieve this objective.
Before he was with the president of the United States on an equal footing, Pena Nieto as governor of his home state, Mexico.
in this densely populated, rambling part of the country that surrounds the capital, are divided over the new head of state.
A direct man
In the remote town Valle del Bravo reminds you, for example, like to him.
residents leave local letter the development of tourism and the construction of infrastructure.
In order to achieve the city, you can drive on one of the highways, Pena Nieto build and a great improvement on the fragile, bumpy roads, it was here.
badges with his name are also outside of a modern sports centre and an impressive interactive museum on climate change.
"We expect him real and lasting change," his friend and political ally he Nietos Gabriel olvera Hernandez, the congressman for the Party, the PRI.
In particular, with regard to the security and the economy, we hope to an interesting and real change that our country so desperately needs.
After 81 years in power, the PRI was replaced by Vicente Fox in 2000.
The congressman olvera, outside the presidential palace that the party after 12 years of Los Pinos great expectations of Enrique Pena Nieto.
The accusations by the opposition, the new President lacks substance, rejects it.
He was a man of very direct, very committed and have great plans for the country.
Above all, he was a great statesman, but it also is someone who can listen.
On the other side of the state, but many people do not share this view on their former governor.
In Nezahualcoyotl, also known as Ciudad Neza to the paved roads of Valle del Bravo, the contrast could not be greater.
The place is hidden under motorway transfers and is in many ways a suburb of Mexico City itself.
and the problems in the municipality are essential urban in nature.
At the beginning of this year, the military was involved, in order to combat the drug gangs operating in the areas, and violence against women is a particularly acute problem.
On a corner of fallow land in the vicinity of a large landfill sites were left the bodies of dozens of women murdered in the last two years alone.
During the term of Governor Pena Nieto were murdered in the state of Mexico, more than 1,000 women-a statistic that exceeds even the city of Ciudad Juarez, which is notorious for its violence and the killings of innocent women.
The critics he Nietos are of the opinion that he is at least not adequately tackled the problem of the murders of women during his time in office.
But in the worst case, his government have closed their eyes to the problem.
In a Betonbau, typical of the decrepit quarters fighting Irinea Buendia with tears, as me photographs of their dead daughter Mariana Luna shows.
According to the official version of events was Mariana 2010 suicide.
But her family believes that she was murdered by her partner.
"When I arrived at their home, it seemed as if their bodies were washed," remembers senora Buendia.
There were signs that she was beaten and rigid had already used the corpse.
While their mother tells their story, looking down on us from the wall a picture of Mariana. Apart from a cross, it is appropriate to a single word: justice.
But it is precisely this, so the family, have been denied her until now.
The authorities have treated me as if I were a SchwäTzerin of mischief-maker, NöRglerin.
They want simply accepted their verdict and shut up.
"But that is not possible if there were many flaws and omissions," she says.
If President Pena Nieto receives the President cement on Saturday, he is also a great responsibility.
Tens of thousands of Mexican families have been affected in the past six years of violence, and the new president has promised to take care of this problem, particularly during his term.
"I hope that as president, he is, as he was as governor," says the PRI congressmen olvera in Valle del Bravo.
but fear the families of the victims in Ciudad Neza most.
The prosecutor claims: Bradley manning did not complained about mistreatment
The public prosecutor's office against Bradley Mannings accusations that he had been mistreated in prison
The hearing deals with the Mannings time in military prison in Quantico, Virginia
The defense is seeking a dismissal of the charges due to harsh prison conditions
The US army corporal accused of thousands of confidential documents stolen
On Friday, the prosecutor's office has tried to establish that the Armeegefreite Bradley manning, accused of the biggest leak of classified information in American history-failed, on several occasions to complain about the allegedly suffered abuse in military detention.
In a cross-examination Mannings during a court hearing in ft. Meade, Maryland said Maj. Ashden Fein, documents to weekly visit, prison officials had made at Mannings nine months of detention in Quantico, Virginia, had no complaints about his treatment.
A day before the cross-examination, which was held following a request from the defence to reject the charge-manning is the hard prison time had already been punished enough-manning testified that he had considered suicide in prison.
The US army intelligence analyst, was arrested in June 2010, is accused of during his tenure in Iraq of thousands of confidential documents stolen.
The material was then published on the Internet by Wikileaks.
Wikileaks has never confirmed manning as a source for the information.
At the hearing on Friday was fine with manning the forms by the officials after their meeting with manning during his detention at Quantico military prison, where he had filled from July 2010 to April 2011, increased detention had sat.
Officials said Manning wrote questions and his answers.
as Sinn Fein questioned him Friday to the forms, he was manning that the treatment by his guards as "excellent" and the treatment by the establishment as a whole had assessed as "very professional".
The forms, so beautiful, contained no complaints about ill treatment, even though officials had asked manning directly on his treatment.
Manning said he had concerns expressed orally and the officials have discussed this with him and, to deal with this, but they had not been recorded.
"They wrote 'no problems' (after meeting the concerns), and not necessarily meant that I said nothing," Manning.
The judge, Col. Denise Lind, manning also asked why he had not complained about his treatment, in January 2011, when he met with a committee of the suicide idea mentioned by him a few months earlier, on a form should investigate.
Manning said his intention during this meeting have insisted that his observation status for "prevention of injury" downgrading.
The military said it had him this status-a stage under the restrictive suicide risk-on his and the protection of others.
"I wanted to convince people that I was doing well and get rid of the observation status on the prevention of injury (...) in order to achieve a higher quality of life from my point of view," said Manning.
Manning said to his arrest and transfer to Kuwait on Thursday, where he was held for nearly two months before in July 2010 in the prison, he was transferred to the naval base Quantico in Virginia.
In Kuwait, he said, he had considered suicide and whether the heat became unconscious.
do not know, what happens with him or in the outside world, was costly.
"My world fell to camp Arafjon, together in this cage," Manning said on Thursday.
I thought I would die in this cage.
When he was transferred to Quantico, manning spent most of his days in a small cell-at least 21 hours and often more than 23 hours-and without society.
We have him only a mattress and a blanket, flip-flops, clothing and his glasses.
Manning said he tried to stay on the move, because on the day it was forbidden to sleep or even on the ground.
He had always sleep with light, the outside his cell.
If he turned at night and see could not see his face, it was well-versed him so that he can turn back the clock.
In January 2011, Mannings lawyer formally objected to the treatment of Mannings.
In April 2011, manning was transferred to the military prison in Fort Leavenworth, Kansas.
on Friday asked the judge manning a charge that he had made in his statement on Thursday, as he had a night of sleep naked in his cell in Quantico and naked in a morning count before guards and other prisoners.
Manning had testified that he had never had the opportunity during this census, with his blanket UmhüLlen.
At the hearing on Friday was manning, he was from a command of its station closed, that he can cover the ceiling, he could have been dropped, and he was, however, that no one had called him.
On Thursday, manning testified that he had been forced to sleep naked in the previous night, he had previously tried to show an official, that he is no threat for themselves.
manning told the officials that he had the federal can use his underwear or flip-flops, to violate, but did not do so itself.
On this night, manning said, were his underwear, flip-flops and glasses has been removed from his cell.
His lawyers hope that the judge will drastically reduce his prison experiences at least take into account and his detention standards, should he be convicted in his trial before the military court. This is scheduled for early next year.
The defence has indicated that manning stand guilty of minor offences, while other charges, which will be seen as too extreme to be challenged.
The continuation of the hearing is scheduled for this weekend, a justification of the conditions expected from the public prosecutor's office.
The Pentagon maintains its position that Manning was held according to the rules, under the highest level of security for all arrangements in Quantico Verwahrten prisoners.
The charges against manning include the promotion of the enemy, illegal publication of intelligence information on the Internet, transmitting national defense information and theft of public property or documents.
He will be found guilty on all charges, he faces a life sentence.
My between Mexico-American identity crisis.
Many people were forced to leave Mexico because of the lack of opportunities
Mexicans tend to blame the immigrants-to remind them serious times, he says
Navarrette believes that Mexican Americans are caught between two worlds
I had on a recent trip to Mexico City has only just arrived into the hall and was at the passport control, I find.
signs pointed to two queues: one for "mexicanos" ("Mexicans"), the other for "Extranjeros" ("aliens").
I was there a few seconds long, uncertain, to which I should go.
I grew up in central California, and my life has been called "Mexicans."
An ethnic acronym-just as my friends in Boston "Irish" or my friends in New York "Italians."
Later, I opted for "between Mexico-American."
But this was Mexico.
and in the home in my grandfather's day, there was no need for acronyms or Hyphenation.
I was just Americans.
I speak Spanish well enough, at least for me in this language at both ends of the interviews.
But I do not have the vocabulary of a mother spoke Lers and my American accent I will also not.
So I took my American passport and put me in the queue for Extranjeros.
I thought about that moment this week when the future Mexican President Enrique Pena Nieto visited the White House with President Obama.
On the agenda of all those issues which are expected when the heads of the two countries, immigration, drugs and trade.
Pena Nieto was also keen to talk about the growth of the Mexican economy. It is one reason that Mexicans today with the same likely to stay in Mexico rather than emigrate to the United States.
He would ally with the United States and Canada and create a North American trading bloc model of the European Union.
and Pena Nieto vowed to continue the war in Mexico against the drug cartels, although he gave no details in this regard.
Mexico's relationship with the United States is complicated and full of resentment.
Most Americans are probably never a single thought that the United States invaded Mexico in 1848 and the leadership of the country, perhaps gun, forced to leave more than half its territory to them.
But for Mexicans in centuries and are not in minutes, memories of this event not to overlook.
Therefore, once a US government officials only mildest criticism of Mexico, we hear, in the Mexican press and among the elites of the country's complaints about how the Americans press their neighbouring country's sovereignty.
monte cripple Zuma and the children are on the war path.
Yet, in truth, is the biggest challenge of Mexico in the relationship with the more than 35 million Mexican Americans who live in the United States.
The inclination to talk about resentment?
There are more than enough.
Mexico has winners and losers. People, provide opportunities for the country, and others, for which it does not.
The only reason why so many people of Mexican origin in cities such as Los Angeles, Las Vegas, Phoenix, Denver and San Antonio, is that at a point in our family tree of life a person-a parents' or grandparents' part, perhaps no chance offered in Mexico and in the north.
and in most cases, this person is a profile-dark-skinned, uneducated, from a poor village, etc.
We are the descendants of these people, and our loyalty is to you.
not Mexico.
and though we might now live the American dream have visited, good schools and good jobs, we must never lose sight of the fact that it is the American dream, we live-not the Mexican.
our identity is sometimes blurred, but perhaps what our loyalty is concerned, this is not the case.
This is clearly the United States.
In addition, we are aware that many members of the Mexican leaders may not.
This is based on reciprocity.
they see us as a monument of a humiliating defeat and looking down on us, because we are not between Mexico and enough.
Our Spanish is never good enough, our ties to Mexico will never be strong enough.
In their view, our very existence is a symbol of the failure.
If our families not failed, then they would not have gone in Mexico.
and then we would not see trapped behind the silk curtain-with a comfortable life in the United States, but somehow lost.
my wife was born in Guadalajara and went to the United States legally as a child, I am reminded that there are tensions between Mexicans and Mexican Americans, also have a clearer idea of who they are, because Mexicans and Mexican Americans taking this evil.
While the US-American citizen, sees it as part of the two countries.
But many Mexican Americans, I know, have the feeling that neither one nor the other country.
We love the Mexican band los tigres del norte, but also Bruce Springsteen.
It enjoys the best of both worlds, but is rooted in none of them.
In Mexico, we as Americans.
and we will be seen as Mexicans in the United States.
as I should learn during my trip, there is something that makes this relationship even more complex: some Mexican leaders and parts of the education bourgeoisie would resume their links to the diaspora.
You want Mexican Americans as a provisional 'ambassador' for Mexico, representing their interests in the United States.
We should tell our American colleagues of how great a visit to this country and to exert pressure on the political leadership to intensify their ties to Mexico.
now.
that will not happen.
many wounded feelings.
and given the unfair distribution of income, rampant corruption and drug violence, many of us are not so sure whether it really is a great country.
I am afraid, because you alone, Amigos.
that is only fair.
If at least some Mexicans are not yet ready for dealing with Mexico, the United States awarded to one and a half centuries ago, they must also accept that some Mexican Americans have a grudge for how their family members have been dealt with until not so long ago.
hmmm.
Perhaps we are 'Mexican' as I thought.
old wars, new Middle East
The cease-fire between Israel and Hamas could prove an unexpected pillars for peace
can it ever be lasting peace between Arabs and Jews in the Middle East?
The latest bloody events seem such a hope to nip in the bud.
In the midst of the usual recriminations countless buildings in rubble, more than 140 Palestinians, most of them civilians, and six Israelis were killed, and for the first time, rockets from Gaza near the Israeli metropolis of Tel Aviv and the holy city of Jerusalem.
But while Israelis and Palestinians seem trapped in their historic conflict, the Middle East is changing around them.
The Arab spring has created a new, uncertain situation, and whether you like it or not, Palestinians and Israelis have become part of this turmoil.
Perhaps this will only lead to more bloodshed.
But there are reasons to believe that the deadly stalemate could finally find their end.
A war lost or gained.
at first glance seems optimistic in view of the current situation is anything but.
Even if the cease-fire agreed on 21 November, the week's struggles have strengthened the hardcore on both sides.
The leaders of Hamas, the Islamist movement which controls the Gaza Strip since 2007, will claim to have pushed back the Israelis, even though his group had even large losses.
Although several Hamas leaders killed and 1.7 million inhabitants of the Gaza Strip in one of the most desolate and most densely populated corners of the planet will be loaded, it is Israel which, until now, has not managed to destroy Hamas.
Indeed, the Hamas in the West Bank, which is controlled by the rival moderate Palestinian group Fatah.
and Hamas leaders could come to the conclusion that they have time on their side.
As Islamists have grown in influence in the Arab world, Hamas has powerful and wealthy friends on their side.
Turkey, a revival, regional power, which was once known as Israel's closest Muslim ally, has taken on the Hamas party-as well as Qatar, one of the richest and most dynamic Gulf states.
Jubilant Hamas supporters believe that an Islamic crescent-Israel from Lebanon in the north, where the militant Hezbollah has the power, Syria, where rebels an increasingly more Islamist-style StüRzung Bashar Assad's face, to Jordan, where Hamas allies could threaten the King.
President Muhammad Mursi and, in particular, the rise of the Muslim Brotherhood in Egypt, the inhabitants of most and most important Arab country-on Israel's southern flank has changed the balance of the region sustainable.
The secular despot, Hosni Mubarak of Egypt until his fall 2011 ruled for 30 years, had only a little time left for Hamas.
In contrast, the Brotherhood VerschwäGert with Hamas and their leaders are more dependent on people's views.
In future diplomatic negotiations could prove the Hamas as an actor, even by Israel and the United States cannot be excluded.
The Israeli hardliners, however, let the opposite conclusion.
Militarily speaking, Hamas is no longer dangerous.
The Israeli anti-missile system, "iron dome" can prove its worth and many of the Hamas rockets have been destroyed.
Israel will not be able to sleep more easily for at least a while.
In diplomatic terms, the United States remain firm in its position, many European countries have made Hamas responsible for the latest escalation of violence.
Israel, have fared well in recent years, particularly under Prime Minister Binyamin Netanyahu, the peace process has been largely ignored.
Although rockets from the Gaza Strip have killed 30 Israelis, since 2004, the country has remained relatively free of suicide bombers, not least thanks to the non-proliferation of the plants in the West Bank and that into the main part of an eventual Palestinian state. To protect the Jewish settlements, which were declared illegal, however, continue to be developed.
Netanyahu is good. his Likud party in the run-up to the elections on 22 January, Avigdor Lieberman has allied with a more combative group.
Why this nanny behind wily Palestinians and leave them in a state of their own?
If you really have the control over the West Bank, would you then do not exactly as their comrades-in-arms in the Gaza Strip, firing missiles?
No, it is better to keep them in check behind the wall and to punish them if they dare to raise the heads.
It may be that the hardliners prevail, but the Arab spring could make you a line by the court.
Even if the Islamists now in power in Egypt and other countries, have little left for Israel, they will concentrate first on the difficulties in their own country.
Israel's defense budget is larger than that of its four Arab neighbours.
A war with the local super power the new Arab governments will hardly help repair their economy.
that the pragmatic president Mursi with Barack Obama, together, in order to achieve a cease-fire, could be a promising sign-and perhaps represent the beginning of a new era.
The Israelis should also think long-term.
While the rest of the Arab world is taking tentative steps towards democratisation, Palestinians are still deprived of their right to self-determination, a powder keg, which no doubt one day will explode in the Israeli-occupied territories, as well as a bus exploded in Tel Aviv this week.
the repression now is undermining democracy in the Jewish state, and with the growth of the Arab population will only exacerbate this situation.
bloody missions for the eradication of the Hamas in the Gaza Strip will be increasing its diplomatic toll over the years.
both sides need a boost from foreign
the right answer is those by the representatives of both sides, most of the rest of the world and more will be represented by this newspaper: two states where Israel for security purposes, areas with its tail between its legs.
The small-- for the near future hope is that the cease-fire outsiders more influence on the implementation of this solution.
together with Turkey and Qatar, Egypt must now stop the flow of arms into the Gaza Strip and is better positioned than ever to Hamas by the idea of a Jewish state on the basis of the 1967 borders, with land exchanges and to convince a shared Jerusalem.
outsiders, Arab nations should also move the Hamas and Fatah to reach an agreement.
that would be done more for the creation of a Palestinian state than with the forthcoming request for UN observer status.
Obama must also play its part to induce Israel to negotiate.
During his first term, he missed the idea of his own peace plan.
far away in the White House, it seems as if he is as a participation.
But this is a regrettable, short-sighted perspective.
The United States have a vital interest in a stable Middle East.
and it includes a peace agreement between Israel and the Palestinians.
Australian laws for a single cigarette packaging force
health warnings and sick body parts to neutral green packets, are the same for all tobacco brands.
The world's first laws for single cigarettes and tobacco packaging in Australia entered into force, so that will brand logos and colours are replaced by neutral Oliv green lid, moreover, with drastic use images, which show health body parts and cigarette smoke sick babies and children.
Apart from the different health warnings and pictures from next Saturday, the only difference between the packs in the brand name are printed in identical, small letters.
Australia leads the world's strictest rules on tobacco packaging.
the Australian Federal Government to divert young people from smoking by the GlamouröSe picture of tobacco consumption.
The government of studies that have shown that people with 26 have not started to smoke, with 99% of disabled likely will not start after.
"We can already see in young children age that you understand the message, the tobacco companies trying to compete with their brand image," Federal Health Minister Tanya Plibersek, quoted studies have shown, for example, that children associate the crown of a logo with the idea of a princess.
Although Australia is one of the lowest smoking rates in the world, and the changes have little impact on the profits of the multinationals, other countries already are considering similar steps.
the tobacco lobby fought hard against the legislation.
So it was with the laws would trade on the black market, which will lead to cheaper cigarettes and easily accessible.
"The legislation will lead to serious, unintended consequences," says Scott McIntyre of British American Tobacco Australia.
Chinese and Indonesian counterfeiters will offer far greater quantities of these products on the streets of Australia.
Others, however, say that the laws have driven their business.
Sandra ha of Zico import Pty Ltd, a small family businesses Etuis, notes that the demand for cigarettes and silicone Cap to cover the intolerable packaging, has grown enormously since the companies, British American Tobacco, Britain's imperial tobacco, Philip Morris and Japan Tobacco Australia two months ago, the supreme court challenge to the legislation failed.
Zico have up to 6,000 units sold to wholesale business and await new stocks.
This is a good business for us.
According to experts, the hooks in the popularity of social media in exactly the population to the plan.
A number of an Australian laws has banned tobacco companies from the TV advertising, it prohibits them as sport sponsors and most traders, cigarettes in shops are no longer forced to interpret. Now the tobacco advertising on the Internet.
The Australian government has banned Internet advertising by local businesses and sides, but has no influence on international sides.
"Tobacco is marketed and has left only a small area, to bid for its products is around the Internet does not," says Becky Freeman, a researcher in health care at the University of Sydney.
On social media such as YouTube, twitter and Facebook, Freeman has seen a rise in experience to brands, which were written by "ordinary people".
The question: is this just a private person who enjoyed Marlboro cigarettes, so that even incorporates a video-or has a marketing agency to do?
British American Tobacco Australia says that the industry rather than marketing focus to deal with the new laws.
It has even gone so far as to pay, the Ukraine, Honduras and the Dominican Republic, to challenge the new rules, those countries in the World Trade Organisation to complain about unfair trade restrictions, although none of the countries greater trade with Australia.
a WTO decision is expected in mid-2013.
According to Plibersek, the government has held talks with other countries, considering the similar packaging laws.
Canada was the first country in 2001, the photographic warnings wrote.
These have now been extended to more than 40 countries, including Brazil, Turkey and Ukraine.
tougher laws are being considered in the UK, New Zealand, South Africa and India.
many Australian show smokers defiantly.
The images do not affect me.
I simply ignoring them.
"It is simply a touch and the box way," says Victor el Hage buy a packet of cigarettes on the printed a photograph with a mouth tumour.
to be honest, there is only one reason why I would stop, and that is my little girl.
James Yu, operators of the tobacco trade 'King of the pack "in downtown Sydney, says that the uniform packaging have filled his shelves.
"I needed an hour to supply Einzusortieren now I need four," says Yu.
"The government should have simply completely ban cigarettes-then we said okay, that's it, we close," adds he obviously upset.
in a constantly Elektrisierten world, it is also time to be bored
Unexpectedly, this Thanksgiving I spent five hours in the airport as the plane was due to mechanical problems and we had to wait for other airlines.
So I had enough time for me to make a few thoughts to boredom.
I do not want to lie.
half a day at the airport waiting for a flight, is quite NervtöTend-even if books, magazines and Iphones available (and tax-free shopping, of course).
But more and more academics and child development experts boredom as something positive.
If it were up to you, it is for us, and our children-ok, sometimes to be bored.
in interesting, so that the brain is forced to trains to lose what is perhaps the creativity.
and because most of us today almost constantly on the one or other screen that benefit us the benefits of boredom, not more.
We should welcome the boredom with open arms?
Yes.
and no.
I will come back.
Like many people, I am always assumed that boredom is a relatively recent phenomenon, which has developed with increasing leisure time.
But Peter Toohey, a professor of Greek and Roman history at the University of Calgary in Canada and the author of "boredom: a lively history" (Yale University Press, 2011) is not.
"Indeed, boredom has a very long history," he says.
The house walls Pompejis fault a Latin inscriptions on boredom, which goes back to the first century.
And then there is the question of how we define boredom, actually.
John D. Eastwood, an associate professor of psychology at the University of York in Ontario, Canada, the problem is that boredom is defined in many ways and has been discussed.
After a long reading of research literature and the presentation of the idea of a focus group of about 100 people, Professor Eastwood and his colleagues came to the conclusion that boredom as the experience, "a satisfactory job, but not to be able to define".
Consequently, boredom, differs from apathy to the effect that the person does not want to be employed, but this.
However, in the case of the apathy that there is no rush to do something.
The key experience boredom, he says, in a "disruption of the attention process, coupled with bad tempered and the feeling that the time passes slowly."
boredom can almost hear such as depression.
However, Professor Eastwood believes, even though these two conditions could be linked, bored people see the problem in their area or the world, while depressive people see the problem in itself.
Sometimes, we believe that US is dull, even if we just have to focus on.
In their study, "the unengaged mind: defining boredom in terms of attention" in German, for example: "the UntäTige sense: the definition of boredom in terms of attention," which appeared in the journal perspectives on psychological science "in September, Professor Eastwood and his colleagues listening to an earlier experiment, the participants a band, a person read a magazine article.
Some groups have heard a loud television programme from the neighbouring area, had nothing to do with the content. others heard it at the lower level, so it is barely perceptible hear these noises, while the third group was not.
The people who barely audible or listening to television, gave more boring than the other two groups feel they have had problems to focus, could find no reason for this and wrote their difficulties of boredom.
If you are trying to concentrate on a difficult and arduous task, the disruption of the attention can lead to boredom, says Mark J. Fenske, associate professor of Neuroscience at the University of guelph in Ontario and one of the authors of the study.
However, if you have a tedious activity, "as the search for defective products to help distract a factory conveyor belt, music and not to feel bored."
In fact, he says, we now know that Herumzappeln and Kritzeln often interpreted as signs of boredom can fight, even by people who remain physically more.
"studies have shown that children who keep Herumhampeln, learn more and more information than those who are forced to sit still," Professor Fenske.
We will all eventually boring-my delayed flight, a film, a particularly Shun dull DröHnender loudspeaker.
But some people bore more easily than others.
researchers to measure these differences, developed a scale to boredom in the 1980's vulnerability. "
on the Richter scale, statements such as' many things I have to do and are monotonously repeat "and" I have so many interests that I do not have enough time for everything. "
With the help of such scale, researchers have found that young is more boring than girls, Stephen Vodanovich, professor of psychology at the University of West Florida, especially with regard to the need for more and greater diversity of external stimuli.
But in general, teenagers are a fairly Abgespannter bunch.
In 1991, Reed Larson, a professor of human and community development at the University of Illinois, an experiment in which he nearly 400 teenagers and their parents by seven or eight times a day with a pager Kontaktierte.
He found that 32% of adolescents were bored in school and do the homework, while 23% claims to be bored if they were not in school.
But only 3% of the parents said to feel bored.
Today, 21 years later, Professor Larson said he did not know whether the percentages are about boredom has risen or fallen.
He was sure, however, that "the youth is seen as particularly boring", mainly because children and teenagers have no major impact on their daily lives end.
So, back to my original question: is boredom, healthy?
in the extreme, sometimes not, because it leads people into extreme physical risks to take and the gambling or drugs to alleviate it, studies have shown.
On the other hand, many philosophers and authors analyse the relationship between boredom and creativity. This opinion is Professor Vodanovich, researched the subject for more than two decades.
"With the boredom, the brain wants a say, that we should do something else," Gary Marcus, a professor of psychology at the University of New York.
But the brain do not always know just what you should do the best.
If a is dull and the energy used to be and to cook, we will be happy to play Gitarre.
But television may evaporate for good feelings to ensure this in the short term but in the long term.
So who has spent his child an Ipad is enough, it can distract you from the boredom. It has not learned to maintain itself or to control, says Professor Fenske.
and he adds: "self-regulation is a situation on the other."
The child learns not only to have more self-control, but also in other areas.
I do not believe that we should celebrate for long time.
We should also not critical.
Instead, our aim should also at ease from the permanent AktivitäTs- and technology sprinkling.
Professor Eastwood agrees.
"It sounds so than we should be more boring, but boredom is the nagging, relentless desire to do something useful," he says.
In fact, he believes that the people just looking for a way to switch off and relax.
"In an environment in which we constantly be stimulated, it is difficult to deal with, once the noise has fallen silent."
in Colorado, there is no clear guideline for the new marijuana law
The 19-year-old community college student and football player Anthony Orozco is in the south-east of Colorado for a crime before a court in this state will soon be legal: the possession of a few tasks and a marijuana pipe, he smoked as this.
According to Orozco, he and some friends were on a September day, with the drive to Kansas in Lamar near the border, when they were stopped.
After the police officers found marijuana in the car, Orozco was summoned for the possession of drugs and drug supplies-excusable peccadilloes, which are equipped with a penalty of $100, and was given a court date.
"We are being treated like criminals," Orozco.
But it is also a?
in the uncertain weeks after the decision of the state to legalize small amounts of marijuana for personal use, depends on the answer to hundreds of smaller less by law, as the location for drug offences.
Hundreds of offences to be marijuana, here and in the state of Washington, approved similar measures, have already dropped.
The police authorities are adults over 21 years for possession of a small extent. This is no longer legally permitted to enter into force as soon as the new legislation in the next few weeks.
But prosecutors in the more conservative counties in Colorado have announced that existing quote marijuana offences and people are still before the courts.
At the same time, Denvers votes in several cities, from the suburbs to the western mountains, new state licensed marijuana business to the opening in their communities.
"This situation is evolving so quickly that I do not know what will happen next," says Daniel J. Oates, chief of police in Aurora, which lies east of Denver.
and regulators in the state of Washington are confused on the head.
They are waiting for a guide to setting up a licensing system for the production, manufacture, distribution and sale of the drug-and have a deadline of 1 December 2013.
The view in Washington is that Colorado is in any case most of the states ahead, as regards the regulation of marijuana. There was legalized the drug for medical purposes, and then for private consumption.
"Colorado has a more regulated market. the state lends itself so well to guide," says Brian E. Smith, spokesman for the supervisory authority for spirits in the state of Washington.
But Smith also that there is no place or system can do more than serve as a rough guide.
"We have no real precedent, we can follow," he adds.
The Washington law, called I-502, enters into force on 6 December and is also the end of a grey area in the state licensing system does not yet exist, but legalized the possession.
and unpleasant practice issues have to be resolved in this time-such as the government's target of a "fair access" to Lizenziertem marijuana with the prohibition of cannabis shops in a radius of 300 metres of schools, parks, playgrounds and childcare should be agreed.
"No, it will be difficult to find a location for a Lizenziertes cannabis business than in urban areas, especially in the urban area of Seattle," says Ben Livingston, spokesman for the Center for Legal cannabis', a recently formed group research.
its staff in Aurora on 21 November, chief Oates sent an e-mail in which he said that the prosecutor would no longer pursue smaller marijuana offences in people over the age of 21 years, and that the police "immediately" will not seek criminal advertisements for these offences.
Chief Oates added that the police will continue to implement urban targets to regulate growers of medical marijuana and drug dealers would continue to be monitored.
In Weld County in northern colorado County prosecutor Ken buck a stricter view.
After the vote, he admitted that his authority would continue to pursue cases of marijuana possession, mainly in order to encourage consumers to withdrawal.
Currently, 119 people in possession of around 50 grams or less marijuana trial, although many were also charged for other offences.
"Our authority has a duty to pursue violations, in which the crime was" indeed stage, buck said in a statement.
The reactions are, even in places like rural Mesa County, where voters rejected the marijuana initiative, ambivalent.
The police circle in grand junction, the largest city of the country, no longer shows adults for the possession of small quantities.
District Attorney Pete Hautzinger supported this decision, but also not decided to drop all outstanding possession proceedings.
"I do not believe that I waste my time to enforce the law until it is changing," he says.
Although 55% of voters supported the measure in Colorado, was clear from the start that it would not be easy, the personal use of marijuana to reconcile with the complexities of the Government and the legal system.
and the contradictory reactions in the whole state promoted among local officials a profound dilemma in terms of the big green experiment.
District Prosecutors if it was a "cultural barrier," says Sean McAllister, a lawyer representing the defendants on trial for marijuana crimes from Denver, and on the ground acting as a spokesman for the National Organization for the reform of marijuana laws.
"They have spent such a large part of their lives, to prosecute people for that you still cannot accept the legalization," he believes.
The first states, the smaller treat marijuana like alcohol, Colorado and Washington, acted as a national model for the legalisation of drugs.
While advocates and state officials to prepare a legal age sales, they are also nervous waiting for orders from the federal government, which the sale and cultivation of marijuana at the federal level continue to treat as a crime.
A spokesman for the legalization Movement hope that the Justice Department will give.
Despite several striking arrests of consumers and sellers medical Marihuanas, the federal government has the sale of medical marijuana in Colorado, Washington and 16 other states for the most part.
Kevin A. Sabet, former drug policy advisor to the Obama government is of the view that law is probably no doors, reluctant to smaller quantities of drugs seized, but probably will, under the new legislation, legal, government-regulated marijuana shops to tolerate.
several cities in Colorado, not even waiting for the federal authorities to act.
Even before the polling day, some local municipalities approved moratoriums on new marijuana business, although this is only open in about a year.
Montrose, a town in the west, decided last week to a six-month ban, which will probably be next week.
"We do not want to get into a position where we have someone who license and then face a major problem at the federal level," Bob Nicholson, a member of the city council.
Our community has voted against this amendment.
Since then, we have decided, for what the community and not for what the state has decided.
There are still many unanswered questions.
Petronella Wyatt: I was from Oxford Gemobbt because I am a Tory
not only attacked university students today for their views
It has always been my biggest dream, to be given a place at Oxford University.
Both my father and my older brother had visited the university I once considered to be the largest know Temple in the world, for a modern Greek symposium, the great pillars of civilisation-- free thinking and tolerance.
But within two weeks after my arrival at Worscester college in the late 1980s, where I had intended to study history-I had my suitcase again and so the first scandal of my life.
My father collapsed in tears.
my friends were confused.
The Evening Standard said it, I would, because I had a problem with that fellow students in a neighbouring room had sex.
The author of a n Wilson said mischievously, I would leave the university because I was forced to drink from damaged cups.
But the truth was less amusing.
I went away.
Yes, well, because I suffered systematic harassment and threats.
not because of my unusual name, or because I was from a private school.
I was harassed for one reason only-a reason in this supposed birthplace of enlightenment to narrow and now seemed cruel: my late father Woodrow Wyatt was an important adviser to Margaret Thatcher and I have been an advocate of the Conservative Party.
Why do I mention this now?
Now, according to recent reports, a new generation of students suffering the moderate right under similar persecution.
The organised and rising hatred of Tory students in Oxford has developed such dimensions that called for a group of them last week, the same equal rights protection to the benefit of gay, disabled people and ethnic minorities.
conservative members of the junior common room (JCR) of the Corpus Christi college, you will be isolated because of their political views "often actively, personally attacked and" declared undesirable.
They call for a place in the Equality Committee of their college, to ensure that their opinions can be expressed freely.
The situation was aggravated by a recent documentary on political students screened on BBC two, "wonderland: young, bright and on the right," the Tories as Eccentrics and neo-Nazis.
It has been shown, among other things, a graduate student Joe Cooke, former president of the conservative Association of Oxford University, in a Rolls-Royce and Silberfarbenem Protzte suit and silver occupied or stock.
other universities say conservative students, they are seen as "scapegoats for the introduction of higher tuition fees".
The 20-year-old Luke black, vice-president of the conservative students Association of the University of Nottingham, was left in a Sunday newspaper said: "There is a growing trend in universities.
The people believe we are as the Bullingdon Club, without us even to have got ".
Samuel Roberts, 21, and history student in Corpus Christi, initiated the request for greater protection, is of the opinion that such a climate is "uncomfortable." the 19-year-old Stephanie Cherill, President-designate of the conservative student association of Oxford says they have JRC Members observed a growing opposition to students of the moderate right.
"This represents a danger for the intellectual discourse and for the well-being of members', she says.
In my first few weeks at Oxford I was such a minority.
As I was unbelievably timid 18-year-old arrived in September 1986.
hatred of the Conservative Party had reached its peak.
Last year, the university had voted in favour of Margaret Thatcher-a former student-because of cuts in higher education to give no official title.
the atmosphere had even Stalinists squirm.
in the first days of the first-week semester in the new students and Tutoren acquaintance, I got a taste of the future events.
I made the experience that the students not only Duldeten Tutoren the mockery of Tory, but even attended it.
political issues such as the miners' strike, privatization and the rejection of the sanctions against the apartheid government of South Africa found their way into the HolzgetäFelten spaces of the Tutoriums.
The first of these events should I French texts translated into English from the 18th century to what then should have been taken, I was not.
"Miss Wyatt", translated as "the tutor said Harry Pitt (died) now," the first paragraph, please.
I stumbled.
Pitt was a small man with a face as creation from cake, and quite unpleasant.
"Thatcher-supporters refuse to learn French, or are they simply stupid?" he asked me.
The other students Kicherten.
Wallten tears in my eyes.
"I suggest that you take a few French in their leisure time hours-in other words, if they are not too preoccupied with their social activities' Knurrte Pitt.
I returned with HäNgendem head in my room.
This evening I sat alone at the dinner in college, when I Tippte someone easy on the back.
It was an English student from the second year on behalf of James, a member of the conservative Student Association.
"I know who you are," he said gently.
Unfortunately, it is as it is.
Everyone suspected, Tory to be harassed.
For me, it is bad enough, but you know that your father is close to Margaret Thatcher, so it will be worse for you.
Most Tory first semester, a supporter of the Labour Party.
Later, in a local pub, I tried to forget.
I insisted that I do not agree with Mrs Thatcher was in all respects.
This ploy should prove unsuccessful.
A first in philosophy, politics and economics, ironically, visited the Eton College as a conservative, said to me: 'You are the daughter of a fascist pig. "
you are polluted.
Other students shared his opinion.
I was perverse and bad way.
"As the Tories have sex? 'asked me.
the other?
I felt so how homosexuals have felt before the more liberal legislation in the United States.
I would ever be able to Oxford University to lead a normal life?
I would like-minded can make only after the collapse of the darkness?
I should like to turn to the Labour Party and suppress my natural instincts?
The three years before me were gradually, my intellectual eye to a purgatory of ostracism and isolation.
The only tutor, to recognise the open as Tory, it was Norman stone, a professor of contemporary history, had its headquarters in my college.
Not only was he hated to be a conservative, but also because he Thatcher in terms of external policy, and wrote speeches for them.
He was only rarely.
He hated the place it was insular and narrow and rejected him for his Marxist-Deterministische historical perspective.
In 1997, he took a professorship at Bilkent University in Ankara in Turkey.
"You will not be happy," he said.
I began to commute between Oxford and the House my parents and took refuge in open-minded friends and family members in the city.
I told my father that I hated Oxford, and why I did it.
He seemed incredulous.
During his time in the Vierzigern all political views were accepted.
"But it is the best place in the world," he said sheepishly.
This is not something they would never do, in my city of TräUmenden Tower alarm.
Even my communist friends always impeccable manners.
his wet eyes marred.
then the whole a chance.
I am sure Neckt you.
It would break my heart if you gingst.
exhausted by my frequent visits to London, my emotional resistance was weaker.
One of my male friends, also Tory supporters, had succumbed to the pressure and abdicated his convictions.
During a Tutoriums seriously in the following week, another history tutor had claimed that I was "an enemy of the people", I decided to do the same.
Although I secretly Zerging in shame, I was that my parents had undergone a "brainwashing" and called them "old dunce."
The relief lasted only briefly.
It was my father, which is the last nail in the coffin of my Oxford-career.
At that time, he wrote two columns per week in the Murdoch press.
my door was closed.
I hid me in my room, and after five minutes gave my persecutors.
as they walked, Packte I a suitcase and took the first train to London.
I never returned.
like you can a Weinerlichen Schlappschwanz.
But 18-year-olds should ever in any educational institution suffer such intimidation and spite.
and it is even more tragic is that it was Oxford-a university, not only had 14 Tory Prime Minister, but up to now hiding behind an unearned reputation of equality and freedom of thought.
"Valentino elegance of the celebrity '
On the occasion of the exhibition "Valentino: master of couture ', which was opened in London this week, ABC with Naty Abascal, Mrs thyssen-Bornemisza and other famous clients of Italian fashion done.

Valentino Shows these personal memories as trophies of his social rise by modest fashion makers in the town of Voghera in northern Italy to the idol of the international jet set.
to be in love with the nobility, must not be a disadvantage.

The two lived in the 1960s and 1970s in the Alps and were good friends.
Valentino is a spectacular, more generous and elegant hosts.
"All of us were, if we have been invited to his house in Gstaad," says the "Heini" thyssen Exfrau, chummy with forgotten beauties such as, for example, marella Agnelli or Eugenie niarchos.
Valentino has always preferred the elegance of the celebrity.
And yet, he is a star.
Valeria Mazza, in a dress by Valentino

fashion the origin
The lives of Garavani, no history of Versessenheit is more mutual love affairs.
He may be people with good education and the highest titles, and they love it.
One of the galleries in Somerset House was turned into a glorious and 60 meters long bridge, a role reversal: the user takes the place of the model and the bridge along a fantastic "audience" to admire the masterpieces of Valentino, as for example the dress for her wedding with AristóTeles Jackie Kennedy Onassis, chose the KostüMe wearing Monica Vitti in "La Notte", or a coat from wool and leather, the empress Farah Diba.
In this audience of fashion dolls radiation as from Sibilla de Luxemburgo, Gloria von Thurn and taxis, Mette-Marit of Norway, Rosario of Bulgaria or SofíA von habsburg.
Naty Abascal and the fashion maker, in 2006
Many of these customers say the first Valentino as the first ladies, "never forget."
I can remember still perfect.
It was a pair of trousers, a shirt, a record "Gillette" type and a jacket from the Autumn / Winter-Kollektion 1971-1972.
"It was a gift from him," says Naty Abascal, one of the designers Musae.
"I prefer it to all the other because of his great love for the women and because it highlights our beauty," adds the ex-Duchess of feira.
I like the colours used very stress; they have a great deal of light and the face.

The Princess and opinion leaders in the fashion Patricia della Giovampaola d Arenberg cannot forget the first time a Valentino.

At the end of the 1990s, there was then.
I bought my first Valentino dress for a festival in the castle of my Vetters, the Prince Edouard de ligne.
It was a red dress with flying rock and a Drapierten upper part of its name, with a Dekolleté honour.
"It was a true attributed dream," says Rodrigo d Arenberg's widow.
"Valentino does not depend on the fashion, his obsession is timeless," explained the Italian Aristokratin between ParíS, New York and Buenos Aires.
The Princess d Arenberg preserved their evening clothes of fashion ',' done 'with absolute care not only because a dress is a dress, but also the associated memories. "
The "king" of fashion

Four months of work and 25 "Ragazze" (as the fashion maker Farbene closer to its domestic) were necessary for this ivory silk dress with pearls, 12 different embroidery and a half metres long Schweif.
According to the journalist Suzy Menkes, the supreme authority of the specialist press, this dress was a milestone in the haute couture at the end of the 20th century, "to return to the customers of the Supreme society."
For years, with the "savoir-'êTre marred the elite, Valentino is now their best copy.
Cavaliere di Gran croce (Italy's highest award), Cavaliere del Lavoro, Commandeur de l 'Ordre des Arts et des Lettres, awarded the legion of honour, cumulatively, Garavani so many, as each of the husbands of its customers.
"I always noticed, for its sophistication, its calm and perfect appearance", d Arenberg.
I told him the last time a month ago at a gala dinner in the museum de'Orsay.
He sat at the table with the Countess Jacqueline De Ribes, a very good friend of mine.
"He was completely; the time leaves no traces of him."
and that says a Princess...
The most difficult job in the world: the human work animals from Kawah Ijen
For four euros, the makers of the Indonesian volcano risk their lives and their health if they are 70 kilogram of sulphur on the steep, rocky paths.
There are people, for their work hell is literally in hell, and other work.
This is the case with Anto Wijaya, a mine of the 400 workers who earn their living by sulphur from the volcano Kawah Ijen in the east of the Indonesian island of Java.
He has every day down to the land of his Kraters, where the gushing from the earth from decimating sulphur tablets containing gas in contact with the air.
After he has extracted large sulphur stones, which can weigh up to 70 kilograms, transported it in two bamboo baskets on his shoulders on the slope of the paths of stone.
there are only 250 metres until the top of the volcano, which is in a height of 2386 metres but the exhausted makers need more than 40 minutes for the rise in tortoise pace, and they must keep the balance and their steps carefully, so that they do not slip and fall.
They know that every step can cost their lives, such as this one French Touristin happened, years ago on the steep slopes of the Kawah Ijen plummeted.
mine workers of Kawah Ijen earn 5 cents for every kilogram of sulphur, which reduce them.
Yet, tracks the path between the tourists, they are like circus monkeys photography and run with the tiring heavy baskets three kilometres to the scales, a mining company has set up a little further down to a height of 1850 metres
The society is PT Candi Ngrimbi never better, since 1960, the deposits in the volcano and (said) exploiting its workers, which it pays 662 Indonesian rupees (5 euro cents) for every kilogram of sulphur.
They then sold for the 10,000 rupees (83 euro cents) to the petrochemical industry, because this mineral is widespread in everyday life and for the manufacture of matches next, fireworks, cosmetics, particular and even used the bleaching of the sugar.
"Since we normally 70 kg for every way we receive around EUR 46.000 rupees (3.8)," says US Anto in the normal case three routes on the day.
for every line he needs three hours that he is completely managed, at the end of the day, but he then 138.000 rupees (11.5 million).
what looks like a lousy pay for such an almost inhuman effort, but it is the three of what he would earn with the field work.
"The daily wage of mine workers here, where the coffee harvest will be paid 15,000 rupees (1.2 euros) a day and the average monthly income EUR two million rupees (167), is very high," explained the source of previously worked as a builder on the tourist island of Bali.
There he earned EUR 75,000 rupees (6.2) a day, and the work was not so hard, but Anto is with his family in Banyuwangi, a village near, returned, and for a reason that is as important as the sulphur in Indonesia: "I married a girl from Bali, where they are Hindus, and I have them to Java to them to convert to Islam."
Anto has asthma, breathing with difficulty, coughing fit often irritate and his eyes are the result of toxic gases.
The 27-year-old Anto is for three years living on the Kawah Ijen is at stake, the sulphur in the first mark, even though he covers his face with a mask and special glasses.
Anto has asthma, breathing with difficulty, coughs and his eyes are often irritate because of the poisonous gases from the volcano.
This is the price he must pay for achieving his dream.
"I am here for another two years because I make a shop or would like to learn Spanish or French," he promises, in a more than decent English.
This pleasant and intelligent, but life Gestrafte young man could work as tourist guides, waiters or the reception of the hotel, but instead he carried out the work of trag Els.
He shares a dirty wooden hut with other agencies and at two O'Clock every morning because of sulphur is also applying its distinctive yellow paint in the darkness at night conspicuous BläUlich.
The shadow face challenging, it is in the light of a small lamp on his helmet, he has bought his own money, the Krater.
About 400 winner on Krater, laden with sulphur soil the baskets on their shoulders.
Despite their huge profits, the mining company, in order to save costs, and provides the sulphur reduction not mechanised the makers working on their own account and paid according to weight, no equipment.
They also get a share of the EUR 30,000 rupees (2.5) surcharge per camera, the guardians of this nature parks, together with the entrance fee to the tune of EUR 15,000 rupees (1.2) of the tourists, the photographs of the volcano and the human sel.
"This work is for the animals and not the people," protested Madrusin, a StäMmiger, 42-year-old winner of three decades since leaving school on the Kawah Ijen is working.
He is in a position to take up to 110 kg and assured that it continues, "as long as it is", because the money for the education of his three children aged between 10 and 18 years.
I will not retire, I will die here because the volcano was my life.
Even if the sulphur the throat burning eyes and touch when the wind suddenly and the mine workers in the thick pillars sticking, graduating from the Krater, the men are so tough that nobody complains about serious diseases... of course, apart from the normal breathing problems, Arthrose, pain in the knees and bubbles on the shoulders, the weight of the baskets have distorted.
The basket on his back, Unainik only in the situation, with its 53 years to 50 kg.
Every day, he and his associates 15 tonnes of sulphur from the volcano, the three trucks on a goat path between the GebüSch transported to camps in Taman Sari in 18 kilometres away.
"I will not retire, I will die here because the volcano was my life," said Unainik, he opens his mouth wide in the absence of some teeth.
of his five children, the oldest is working with his 30 years as sulphur-makers.
As time passes, but the meagreness, generation to generation in one of the hardest jobs in the world: the human burden those donkey on the Kawah Ijen work.
Singapore needs babies to rescue the economy.
The Singapurer shift the blame that on the career, the stress they have no children, and the cost of real estate and the upbringing of children.
"The population of Singapore has to grow."
I am a patriotic husband, you are my patriotic wife: we are fulfilling our duty to the people, and we live!
It seems incredible that the verses are part of an advertisement for Minz candy, but-or just because they were at the beginning of this year in Singapore to a Viralen video on YouTube.
The rates are part of a Rapper-Song, the local sayings such as "pushing a" Bao "(loaf) in the kiln, in order to make fun of the low birth rate in Singapore.
The advertising agency Bbh, which preserves the video films, the hope that the advert in combative way, to draw attention to the problem.
its creative director, Douglas Hamilton says that he wanted to use the power of the music, the people to meet its "national duty."
This is something for the Internet, so we had to make it fun and funny.
It is the biggest problem in this country.
The breed, we are the worst in the world, therefore, we observed that it is a subject that we had to take care of us.
We knew that the government had tried many things, as for example the marketing of perfume with Pheromonen or the organisation of speed-dating-evenings (fast flirting).
It is possible that many of these ideas were creative, but not necessarily led to success.
We thought: why do we not do something as creatively as possible, in order to address this problem, such as a rap Komponieren?
1.2 children
If this is not an easy issue, the Government of Singapore.
Each year, 1 300 US dollars for political measures, in order to encourage the citizens to have more children.
A package of the government granted to married couples and parents up to $15,000 per child, extended maternity leave and distributed tax benefits.
But everything has so far had little success.
Singapore is a wealthy, highly technological city-state in South-East Asia, also known for the conservatism of its leaders and its strict social controls is.
According to its national population authority, the birth rate is currently at 1.2 children per woman.
The last time the rate of fraud-which is also known as the replacement rate-was in 1976.
So why not more Singapurer children?
the national population office Tan Wei Ming, Director for marriage and family policy, says that this "better education" and "greater career opportunities".
"This has allowed the people, except to marry and form a family to have far more options in terms of life goals and priorities," says.
These changes in the social conditions to have contributed to the higher number of single and delay on the marriage and birth, which is a result of the reduction in the birth rate in Singapore.
Meanwhile, an immigration policy which led to a surge in immigration, counter to the reduction of the population to resentment among the local population.
In Singapore, there are Web sites, where hardly any covert xenophobia against many new immigrants is flourishing, especially against the Chinese, who criticised that they keep wages low and not integrate.
The rise in immigration is also regarded as one of the reasons that the government party in Singapore last year reached its worst election result since independence.
Since the elections, an attempt was made, to correct the problem with higher contributions and charges for foreign workers.
unexpected consequences
While the falling birth rate, the impact on the economic growth of the nation, the tax revenue, the cost of health care and immigration policy, the example shows Singapore has unexpected consequences.
The government is trying to achieve, that not so many small homes to be built.
So it has an impact on the housing market.
The Urban Development Authority has started to control the number of small apartments, which are known as the "shoe boxes" and must be built in certain areas of the city.
these apartments have a residential area of 46 square meters and show a huge sales success.
The concern, though, is that they can promote the lifestyle of single, and that they deter firms from great to build housing for families.
But Lim Yew soon, director-general of the real estate company El developers, says that his "sell" much faster than shoe boxes more housing units.
They are so popular, and the units are long days and even weeks faster than the larger housing units.
The result of this is that they are much better for our cash flow.
He is, however, that the new standards give the developers clearer guidelines, which were previously placed obstacles in the way, if you want to build many small housing units in a project.
too much stress
Singapore is a city-state.
Even if these new rules could pave the way to an increase in the national birth rate, the talks with the Singapore pieces, from working in the financial quarter, that they will not have a major impact.
"The people are very stressed, housing and education are expensive, so many will be delayed," says a young managers.
Children can get others.
"It is important for me to have my own time and money," says another, roughly 20 years old man.
men and women, their careers, the stress and the costs for the property and education as reasons that they cannot have children.
That is why the Singapurer have the last word when it comes to children, because the Government can still do so much.

The case of the 14-year-old José is different.
The teenager has user accounts in Hotmail, Facebook, my space, and ask, ask it, 20 of the people not to know that he has attached to his friend list.
"that frightens me not because we have something in common, for example, it music."
The young has no hints about him or asked for his address or telephone number.
"If anyone pestering me or they demanded of me Entferne I simply my user account 'he.
José appeared to ask, after he had read a recommendation on twitter.
The young are not unknown experience, today known as cyber bullying.
The well-known a friend was in a social network.
They threatened him and demanded money.
"He has never found out who it was," he assures.
According to José, the victim of the user account.
"He has made it only private."
He then explained a number of steps to ensure a user account Konfigurieren.
In contrast to Jorge, the young high-laden photographs of known in uncomfortable or embarrassing situations.
Yes, I would do that, if he is not me or I want one judging him.
"But I know that this is cyber bullying," he said.
Key issues
Marie Porras, a teacher of English with degrees in education and learning, believes that the children and young people, it must be understood that the purpose of social networks is to inform.
"The Internet emerged as a medium for the search for information, with the appearance of these pages, but the rules of the game have changed," she says.
Porras explains that the academics Marc Prensky, holder of a master-title in teaching at Yale University and author of the plant "digital natives and immigrants' grew these concepts to explain the phenomenon.
The digital natives, the children and young people who have grown up with this technology.
"We are the digital immigrants, who they are, where we are still learning," he says.
He said that it is a complex issue, "because we are asking of you, that you have a defined criteria, what can be said or published, and this in an age where the maturity is not enough."
"They should also be pick if it is most important to them, to be loved, thousands have friends, without thinking about the consequences", he added.
According to the expert, the children and young people is the most effective way to teach what privacy, to ask you questions, you think.
"You say you should not do, is not working," he says.
Porras, then some possibilities: there are things you not to tell strangers would, then why do you on the Internet?
or: would you like it if you published a photograph of you, such as the one you have published by a friend?
Do you know what others publish on you?
you have other people asked for permission in advance, if you have photographs of celebrate labelled?
and one more question: must all be aware of what you do at any moment?
Another point is to give them to understand that they must act online as they do offline.
the same rules.
"someone outside of the Internet, with respect, decency and other principles, and the same must apply to the social networks," he says.
surveillance
Estuardo Guardia, university professor, primary school teachers and educational consultants, comment, that it is essential that the parents of the directives of the social networks carefully.
If you understand all the parts they have solid foundations for their children to talk about the importance of EröFfnens one user account on the Internet.
"For example, the age or what parts or publish," he says.
According to Guardia, children of the lesson, "thou shalt not speak with strangers".
The conclusion of the summit of the Unasur without publication of the Lima Declaration
The sixth summit meeting of the presidents of the Union of South American nations (Unasur) ended today in Peru without publication of the Lima Declaration, which was previously announced and in theory should be signed by the ruling Seven.
EFE, repeatedly tried to access the document signed at the sixth ordinary session of the heads of state and government leaders of Unasur. Sources in the heads of state and presidents shared services initially that it would be after the conclave on to a certain time, but said then that it would be published on the website of the Peruvian government.
in questions to the text, that the content of the presidents of Peru, Ollanta Humala, was laid out in brief statements to the press.
The journalists access to information on the summit was limited at any time.
in the press room during the day, it was only the image of the President meeting without tone with the message "private meeting, limited audio".
The few information floating around among the journalists, the press from some of the Unasur governments present at the meeting, but not from the Peruvian press spokesman.
the only document that was prevalent during the day, the list of the participating presidents was what caused unease in the hundreds of journalists of various national and international media, which called for more information.
then signalled the presidency of Peru the media an e-mail with the final declaration of the summit, but the statement by Humala and not the official document on the conclusion of the summit meeting.
Last October, Peru was host of the third summit of South American-Arab States (Aspa), and even more forcefully on this occasion, despite calls by the press the so-called declaration of Lima, which it had previously announced, just published.
on the official website of the Aspa, we can convince that the document was published last Tuesday.
Two international meeting stressed the Peruvian authorities, for journalists, there would be limited but that the information systems in a high level access to the information.
The summit ended with the common commitment of Chile and Peru, adopt a judgment of the Court of Justice in the Hague, which settles a border conflict between the two countries.
The presidents of Chile and Peru, Ollanta Humala, SebastiáN PiñEra, met during a regional meeting and confirmed that they would accept the decision of the ICJ, which starts on Monday in The Hague, in the process, the Lima against Santiago, listen to the pleas on both sides.
"We will judge the differences we currently comply with this international court, and together with his Chilean export," Humala said.
"Chile has been, is and will remain a country that adheres to the international laws, seeking peaceful solutions to disputes, agreements and submitting to the international courts," adds PiñEra and GrüßTe Humala with hands pressure above the flags of both countries.
The confirmation of both presidents that they would submit to the ICJ, happened after Colombia after a decision on maritime borders with Nicaragua, which it considered to be a serious mistake to take action against the agreement of Bogota had what it agreed to abide by the rulings of the International Court of Justice.
Present at the summit were the president of Brazil, Dilma Rouseff, of Venezuela, Hugo Chavez, Evo Morales of Bolivia, and of Argentina, Cristina Kirchner.
Paraguay, which since 2011 following the dismissal of its President Fernando Lugo is excluded from the Unasur, attended the meeting.
The host president Ollanta Humala, the talks opened in the morning and ended the summit shortly after the midday in Lima.
The head of state read the final document, which said that 16 decisions and guidelines for 31 projects between the South American countries on an investment amount of $17 billion.
The decisions taken, he said that the Unasur countries' significant steps towards the goal of a South American citizenship, which we extend the decisions on residence rights. "
He said that measures would be taken to "cooperation in the fight against insecurity in the city and to improve against organized, transnational crime, and measures to access to medicines and the Internet at low prices to improve in all areas of South America, and to work together in the event of natural disasters and to act effectively."
"The economic consolidation with the crisis in Europe (in Latin America) no triumphant trains, but is intended to increase our output and a better future for our peoples," added Humala.
"We have decided to give priority to a number of 31 flagship projects, the spatial improve connections in South America, and especially in rural and border areas... and therefore our countries to unite and develop new forms of economy," the Peruvian president said in a statement read.
Among these projects would also be five Peruvian on the axles across its territory of the coast to Brazil, and with two aims to better link with Ecuador, although he gave no further details.
Also, the final document relating to the political situation in Paraguay.
"We hope that the electoral process in this country for its re-entry into the Union of South American nations', from which it is excluded.
The need for Latin America to continue with an integrated region for prosperity and peace and good neighbourly relations, was another aspect, which was highlighted at the summit.
In this sense, the president of Colombia, said Juan Manuel Santos, before beginning his participation in the regional meeting that he on Saturday in a meeting with his face of Nicaragua, Daniel Ortega, Mexico expected to the maritime conflict after a Bogotá in question the judgment of the ICJ, respectfully.
"Perhaps I will tomorrow (Saturday) meeting with the president Daniel Ortega," said Santos.
"We will review all these ways-they are not exclusive, and the agreement with Nicaragua talks with Nicaragua is needed," he emphasized.
"I hope the President Ortega to be able to say that we treat this matter as civilized and respectful as possible," added Santos.
Santos and Ortega were meeting in Mexico on Saturday, where they have the intention, the inauguration of the country's new president, Enrique PeñA Nieto to be present.
As part of the summit, also met in the run-up to the defence ministers of the bloc for the adoption of the action plan for the year 2013, what the dialogue and consensus in regard to the defence of the region can be strengthened.
Argentina, Bolivia, Colombia, Ecuador, Peru, Chile, Brazil, Uruguay, Venezuela, Guyana, Surinam and Paraguay are members of the Unasur, even if the latter is currently excluded.
Peru has the presidency of the regional bloc.
"America needs to learn in the integration of the citizens," says Rafael Correa
The President of Ecuador, Rafael Correa, confirmed today that the creation of a common citizenship is an objective, "South America can actually learn something from Europe."
Correa, of the sixth meeting of the presidents of the Union of South American nations (Unasur) Summit was held in Lima in Peru, told the state television that the Europeans "in the second world war and other conflicts were killing" and "are now virtually a homeland."
In this sense, he defended the project to create a South American citizenship, which the members states of the Unasur.
"must be achieved the free movement of citizens and workers in all South American countries, as is already the case in the Andean Community, however, there is still a reactionary sectors who want to see a return to the past," he warned.
The President of Ecuador, also supported the reform of the Organisation of American States (OEA) under the target to reduce the influence of the Anglo-Saxon countries and to take account of those who have signed the San José agreement on human rights.
The lessons, never commit themselves to something, and, in return, we sign the South Americans always do everything.
"It is incomprehensible that the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights has its headquarters in Washington and will be financed by the United States," he said in reference to the political asylum, Ecuador, the founder of Wikileaks, Julian Assange, has granted.
Correa stressed that he did not regret this decision, because it will not have betrayed his principles, but his "complied with deep democratic values and views on human rights".
He added that there have been "well-founded suspicions at the time that Assange would be extradited to a third country and non-compliance with the procedures."
He also criticised the Swedish judiciary, which he asked for him to submit to interrogation because of alleged sex crime on its territory, while the Swedish legislation allows it via a video conference on the embassy of Ecuador in London can be carried out. "
Correa said that the danger that would undermine the health and mental state of Assange.
"since he is in our message is, I have not talked to him, the ambassador has informed me, however, that he has a slight problem with the lungs, but it is not serious," said the head of Ecuador.
There is a danger, though, that he is physical and mental damage forgiven because he was caught in a narrow area and could not carry out physical exercises in free.
"It would be detrimental to the health of all people," he added.
Correa was that the solution to the asylum, Assange has been granted since the month of June in the embassy of Ecuador in London, the granting of a free letter which he could travel to Ecuador, and that this is in the hands of Europe's Great Britain, Sweden and the legal authorities. He emphasised that there have been talks with London in order to find a solution for the imprisoned founder of Wikileaks.
We do not act with human rights, we turn this word in this case not to have permanent talks.
"The solution for this problem is in the hands of Great Britain, Sweden and the legal authorities in Europe, because the lawyer for Assange, Baltazar GarzóN, a number of procedures at various European bodies," he said.
and "when Britain granted licence tomorrow, in my opinion, this is done."
and if Sweden Mr Assange at the embassy of Ecuador in London or on Skype VerhöRte made, as the Swedish law permits, and in other cases, was the problem.
Correa used the opportunity to confirm itself as a defender of the freedom of the press and said that he will not tolerate, "the mediocrity, the sinister intention and the lie that infringe the freedom of expression."
"the biggest enemy of press freedom are not the evil and perverse politicians, but bad journalists, the pursuit of profit and blackmail," he said.
In this sense, he congratulated Ecuador that not more of such journalists' and not dominated by the bankers or hegemonic and tables bourgeois countries', and I think he will be a re-election "will deepen the revolution in order to continue moving in the right direction."
Correa also supported the decision to veto against Paraguay in the Unasur maintain at least until the next elections, arguing that the legal body must remain "hard and no opportunism and no Verkleideten May coup d'éTat," because "the legitimacy of the democracy in Paraguay has been destroyed."
The President of Ecuador is also keeping the desire his Colombian counterpart, Juan Manuel Santos, and now after the judgment of the International Court of Justice in the Hague, which before the maritime sovereignty of Nicaragua, with Nicaragua to negotiate the maritime legal limits between the two countries, for "absolutely justified."
This judgment will not be implemented at the moment.
It is a problem between a South and Central American state.
conflicts are inevitable, but it must be overcome in pursuit of a common path.
They must be dealt with, so that they can be overcome and look forward.
He also relied on a good conclusion to the dispute over the sea border between Peru and Chile before the same court and said, "it is right for Latin America that recourse to international bodies, if both countries undertake to adopt the ruling, even if it is very harsh."
in relation to the possibility that he, as a candidate for the next presidential elections in Ecuador, in order to achieve his third mandate in a row, he admitted that he "with a lot of optimism and joy this possibility, though it is sometimes very difficult."
Correa promised that if he could lose the elections in February 2013, he would withdraw from political life.
power has never interested me personally, but in such unjust circumstances as in Ecuador this socio-economic poverty can only be corrected by the political power.
"My political movement had the belief that I was the likely victory guaranteed, so I must fulfil this responsibility," he said.
If I win, it would be my last period as President, then I am back from public life.
This also applies if we lose.
"It is decided," he said.
Correa also adopted to tackle the health problems of the President of Venezuela, Hugo Chávez, in Cuba.
I was with the vice-presidents of Venezuela, NicoláS Maduro. He told me that he went for a planned routine treatment that would have expected, and that he could travel to Cuba again after the election campaign.
"In any case, it means a relapse in the state of health of President Chavez," he commented.
The Ecuadorian leader adopted today in Lima on the sixth summit meeting of the heads of state and government of the Union of South American nations (Unasur), which ended with the call for greater regional integration in order to ensure a sustainable progress, equality and security.
The cause of a dying because AIDS is now a late detection
Fabrizio was 21 years old when he confirmed the investigation result: HIV-positive.
"It was as if a bombshell," he says of the moment, in which he received the diagnosis, the doctor without visible success "tried to weaken."
He hid it from his family.
He decided to look just about his illness and began to inform; and that with such use, that he just celebrated his 43rd birthday.
It is, without doubt, one of the oldest patients of HIV unit of the hospital civil de Guadalajara (HCG), in which he came after several fight in 1994.
Fabrizio is living with the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) for 22 years, which was difficult at the beginning of the 1990s, when there were many doubts, few treatment options and more stigma.
At the time, avoiding even the director of a clinic of the Imss to adopt "because it led to a dead end."
AIDS was synonymous with death.
Today, it is possible to survive this syndrome also with quality of life.
However, there are still many people in the hospital, unaware of their disease and where the virus has already been damage, your immune system has outlived its usefulness, and the victims of opportunistic infections.
Thirty years after the incidence of AIDS in the world, in other words after the first reported cases, "the great success today means that the survival of patients, the treatment time and the survival of the general population are exactly the same," said the head of the HIV unit of HCG, Jaime Andrade Villanueva, and he said that this information was backed by a prominent scientific publication in April this year.
The expert for infectious diseases and HIV / AIDS, Andrade Villanueva, commented that the scientists since the 2008 concluded that AIDS is not a death sentence, but that the years of survival and quality of life of the extent of the damage to the immune system attached to the people at the start of treatment, and that those who have greater opportunities, which are not dependent on drugs: up to 30 years in a count of 200 CD4 and 50 years in a count of 500 CD4.
Simply put, the above remarks mean that anyone who gets diagnosed HIV-positive in the 25 years of age "can easily be 75 years old, in this sense, as long as it is under control," said the expert.
In order to be able to properly classify this progress, it must be remembered that the life expectancy of Mexicans live an average of 76 years.
Even if the mortality has decreased significantly in the last few years (in Mexico, the number of people who die of AIDS, 6.678 cases in 2007 to reduce the Onusida 4.862 in 2011 (annual report)), it is nevertheless true that since the AIDS died 60% of patients covered in the national database.
In Jalisco, in 2011 255 people died alone, and until the month of May this year, there are 187 deaths; however, rest assured that there is universal access to anti-retroviral drugs since 2005.
So people still die-why?
In my opinion, the problem is not the access to treatment.
This is my opinion, and that is in our hospital.
At least in the past 12 years, we have not had any problems with the drugs, the problem is that the people in far advanced state, because they do not know their infectious State, i.e. in very late stages of the disease.
He makes a striking statement: "nine out of ten patients come to us, if they already have a lifelong infection. Earlier diagnoses are needed in order to influence the global mortality, why all the people where this is necessary, must be offered screening massively."
This proposal, the experts and officials of the consejo estatal de PrevencióN del Sida en Jalisco (Coesida) (State Committee for AIDS prevention in Jalisco) and patients such as Fabrizio, carry out the test at a private laboratory, and the only reason that it had made a friend of him, despite his young age was already in the AIDS-phase and even had the Kaposi Sarkom (a cancer tumor), which is the usual complications.
everything is different, if you know that you have AIDS.
Some think that they will die, and we want to hear.
"If I die, then three times burst," says in my case.
The amendment was to improve, I ErnäHre me well, sport and take note of the medicines.
We now know his parents that he had cancer.
I live a normal life, like any other.
"I am standing much, have an active, but responsible sex life, I respect on my health and that of the other person," one Fabrizio, the agreed to his intimate details with Milenio Jalisco to share, with his testimony to encourage those who are today within the framework of the World AIDS Day.
You should make the test if they belong to the risk group. The sooner you know whether they are HIV-positive, the better, and if you already know the diagnosis, they should learn how to live as all the people responsible.
his message is a summary of the fight against AIDS in 2012.
condoms behind the counter
There are large holes between the health programmes and the ordinary citizens, said Ricardo Salazar, a journalist from Guadalajara, which has adopted the cause of HIV.
and the most important thing is prevention.
The increases in certain places, "the distribution of condoms actually was; previously they were individually, now give us packages to hundreds of piece, which is good, but there are still people who have no access to a condom," he said.
The high-risk individuals for new infections among young people.
"What need you?" is a question of widespread ridicule of social workers, staff orientation in schools, employees in pharmacies and health system, the young people do not want to expose, assured the correspondent.
He suggested to adjust this inefficient distribution; the condoms are not only behind the counter, but in issuing equipment in public toilets facilities, often visited by young people.
It should not be promoted promiscuity.
It should not be paid for the beer and motel, as the governor Emilio Gonzalez replied to the question on whether under its management would be distributed condoms.
"sexuality is not; it is best, the condoms to bring it closer to those who already have a sexual activity", brought it to the point.
key data of Jalisco
There are cases 13.435 accumulated (12.158 1.317 AIDS and HIV).
the state National seen in 4 new and cumulative AIDS cases and 13 in relation to HIV.
92% of the infection cases on sex, 6% of the blood and peri-natal 2%.
It is estimated that 50,000 people living with HIV, because there are people who are registered for each case of 4 or 5, do not know.
after the Court of Appeal, the United States has confirmed a verdict that the restructuring of the liabilities of the bankrupt group vitro does not recognise, on a trade in Mexico has been achieved, a sinister precedent for each national companies with offices in the neighbouring country, the payment problems.
So you could say that the procedure for the survival of the companies, the Mexican laws allow, in the land of the stars and stripes in contradiction of international agreements have no validity.
In practice, on 15 June, the recognition of the judgment handed down by the judge Harlin Hale at the court to ban car rotas for the Northern District of Texas, the Mexican companies are exposed to the confiscation of their property on the other side of the river Bravo helpless.
However, the decision opens the largest glass manufacturer in Mexico and opens the door to three inconsistencies the Supreme Court of the United States.
While the judges issue indicates that the creditors must be subject to the bankruptcy laws of the United States says the appeal of the fifth circuit, based in New Orleans, first of all, that it is dealt with in the main proceedings of the Mexico trade bankruptcy.
The first point would mean that the international cooperation in the procedure in the event of the insolvency of companies with trans-national profile is not known.
To this end, was indeed the model law for the unification of the international trade law, the United Nations and the American law institute was used as arbitrators.
Secondly, the judgment that, without the votes of societies for the recognition of liabilities in the liquidation of the branches of vitro with their parent company had not achieved the necessary majority for the restructuring of the debt.
However, this option is recognised by the Mexican laws.
Indeed, vitro is not the first case in which this system has been approved.
There are half a dozen examples, including Agremex and comercial Mexicana, whose liabilities among companies of the group by the Instituto federal de Concursos Mercantiles (Federal Institute for trade bankruptcies) confirmed.
It is also true that after deducting the votes of the branches of the creditors of vitro, the creditors in the courts of the United States against vitro-cases, i.e. the vulture funds, such as, for example, Aurel ios capital, Aurel ios convergencia, Elliot internacional and Liverpool have limited, no majority.
The vote would be 45 percent against 37 per cent.
This is not taken into account by the Court of Appeal.
On the other hand, there are other vitro blame for its difficult situation from 2008 in the context of the serious economic crisis in the United States, which gave the country strikes.
For this reason, the Sada family GonzáLez before the same court objection to the vote in plenary, in other words by all judges voted, because only three of them.
is not met, the Cerciorare-lodged, calls for the review of the procedure by a higher authority, in this case by the Supreme Court of the United States.
The most serious in this case is that the court a document aside, the government of Mexico under the Figura amicus curiae (friend of the court) was sent, what the in vitro procedures carried out within the framework of the law on trade described bankruptcies, and pointed out that it had kept to the letter of the agreement signed by the two countries, in order to comply with the Chapter 15 of the bankruptcy law of the United States.
It also pointed out that the country subject to the principles of the United Nations Commission on International Trade, which is to say, it has laid down the rules for the cases of cross-border insolvency, guarantee the equality of debtors and creditors.
Zweibandige Karambole: a blow for vitro and for the country.

Dragon Mart is surrounded
at a meeting at the weekend at a University of the Caribbean Forum, a group of national and foreign environmentalists, academics, businessmen and members of the civil society, the creation of a broad front decided to oppose the opening of the Chinese Dragon Mart in CancúN.
As you know, we are talking about a huge sales and distribution centre in Mexico, Central America and the Caribbean with products from the country on the other side of the wall, supplemented by a residential area for the staff of 150 companies.

because the government is a question of the Senate to explain, under what conditions and circumstances of the Mexican ambassador in Japan signed the anti-counterfeiting trade agreement, which is known under the English abbreviation ACTA, has failed, the matter has already been recorded under the Mexican Institute for intellectual property.

HéCtor "Hetin Reyes:" Basketball was my life '
the worlds truant basketballs, HéCtor "Hetin Reyes was the basket sport longer than 60 years and has traveled to the whole world.
few in Puerto Rico have such a great intellectual collection of the history of the country such as basketballs HéCtor "Hetin Reyes.
Before he was wheelchair by a stroke in 2008, Rexes 6 years was part of the sport, as a player of lower classes, players in the first national league, agent and head of the BSN with the vaqueros de BayamóN or president of the Basketball Association.
"I have spent my life in basketball many hats on, even several at the same time, when I was president of the BSN, chief executive officer of the national team and President of the Association was in the 1990s," recalled Reyes in a visit by Primera hora in his own home in BayamóN, where he entrusted with Isabel, his wife for more than 50 years, lives.
"Basketball was my life."
Reyes exaggerates with this statement.
The walls of his house are almost all Dekoriert and they show with photographs and memories of his long career.
BayamóN heart
The most emotional memories are those in his time in the vaqueros of the mid-1950s as a player until 1982, where he celebrated with his 15-year anniversary as Chief Executive Officer and Director of the club.
"These were my best years, which I have enjoyed the most, because I was part of eight championships since 1967 of the vaqueros as directors, managers or coaches.
There were many fulfilling years, including the five championships in a row from 1971 to 1975.
and then I with a championship in 1981, the year of DebüTs of Jerome MINCY BSN.
From then took "cuco" Ortiz, was a very good manager, "says Reyes.
I know that gene Bartow, worked here as a coach, and the University of Alabama (Birmingham), said: "I have a very strong and 2 m great players.
MöChtest you it? "
and that was the beginning of MINCY, one of the best players, the Puerto Rico has ever had.
then the free performance specialists Raymond Gausse, bartow recommended a citizens and was one of our best launchers.
Still, as he said, I know that, if a cup of bayamon, MINCY Gausse for further concerns.
The championship was the vaqueros with Gausse granted him, but from a distance, because he was already at the top of the Association in 1988.
This time, he drew his application and MINCY to enjoy in the national team.
I remember when we won for the first time at the pre-Olympic tournament in Mexico against the United States.
Then there was the 1990 World Cup, where we should have been the fourth documented what bronze would have been, if not this Canadian referee, we repeated the last Spielzug for the second time, Reyes said.
This group of the 1990 World Cup was the best team you have ever seen?
It is one of the best, as well as those who won in the Olympic Games in 2004 against the dream team.
But my favorite is the team at the Pan American Games in Cuba, where we won gold in 1991 and the team the United States offered a fight, as when they won bronze at the World Cup against us.
When the team were not only MINCY Gausse, Ramon Rivas, Fico LóPez and "PiculíN (Ortiz) (Javier) again, but also the young players' ToñIto 'ColóN and James Carter, LeóN (Francisco and Edgar) and Mario Brothers' Quixote 'morales, the 1990 could not be due to a knee injury.
The team, which was perhaps not the best in terms of personalities, but won a gold medal and the US with great pleasure, those of the Olympic tournament was NeuquéN, Argentina in 1995.
with players such as "Canito" nieves, Pablo Alicea and the young Rolando Hourruitiner as a substitute for the blockage of players because of the events at the Pan American Games in Mar del Plata, we oppose any forecast won the gold medal.
who was the best player of Puerto Rico?
This was, without doubt, PiculíN Ortiz.
His figures at the level of international tournaments are impressive.
No one in Puerto Rico has dominated at this level as PiculíN.
and this is without taking account of his career in the various leagues, in which he has played.
who was the best coach for Puerto Rico?
This is a difficult issue.
We had a number of good coach Julio Toro, Flor MeléNdez, Carlos Morales, Raymond Dalmau, Armand Ito Torres.
The young, I like the work of Leo Arill well.
What Glaubst you is the best of what you have achieved in the Association?
I was part of the most successful era of the BSN team from 1988 to 1995, the beginning of the 1990s up to 17 teams in a season.
what you have to do?
There are things I would have imposed, such as the regionalisation of the lower categories.
The boys play in Ponce, for example, only in their area and only the National playoffs on teams from other corners of the island.
Today, many make the children unnecessary travel and games.
At least, I see the outcome of the required training and courses for coaches, officials and referees.
I am proud of that.
What do you do today?
I listen to music, see music videos from YouTube, enjoy my grandchildren and my time and I can go to a basketball game.
and, of course, I enjoy the company of my wife, Isabel, who was always by my side.
