The Higgs-Boson analysed ||| The Higgs boson revealed
The announcement of the likely discovery of the Higgs Bosons has a certain sensation last summer, and for good reason. ||| The announcement of the probable discovery of the Higgs boson created quite a stir last summer, and with good reason.
In fact, we believe that this Boson is involved in nothing less than the mechanism, which is responsible for the mass of all the objects in the universe. ||| Indeed, it is believed that this boson is part of the mechanism responsible for the mass of everything in the Universe, no less.
and it is the last particle whose existence of the standard model, our best or 'least wrong' explanation of nature and behaviour of the matter, predicted, but has not yet been observed empirically. ||| Also it is the last particle whose existence is predicted by the Standard Model - our best or "less worse" explanation of the nature and behaviour of matter - but which has not yet been observed empirically.
for physicists, however, it is still not completely sure that it really is the Higgs. ||| But for physicists, it is still not completely sure that it really is the Higgs.
We know without a shadow of a doubt, that we have a real new particles, and that the predicted by the standard model Higgs-Boson much resembles. ||| We know without a shadow of a doubt that it is a new authentic particle, and greatly resembles the Higgs boson predicted by the Standard Model.
In addition, this appears to be confirmed by new data this week have been presented at a major physics Congress in Kyoto, but there are still no data in order to be completely safe. ||| In addition, new data unveiled this week at a large physics Congress in Kyoto seem to confirm this, but there are still insufficient data to be perfectly sure.
But we assume that it is indeed the Higgs, because apparently there is only a low risk to deceive, and we look at what it is. ||| But let's suppose that it really is the Higgs, since the chances of being mistaken seem slim, and see what it is.
In this world, there is a crucial law, which means that two objects cannot be at the same place at the same time. ||| In our world, there is a fatally unavoidable law which states that two things cannot meet at the same place at the same time.
It is not possible to violate this rule-and try not to, because they will hurt. ||| There's no way to break this rule - and don't try too hard, you'll go mad.
Even if the particle physics is a really strange world, it turns out that for such a law, they also applies: the Pauli exclusion principle established, the states that two particles cannot occupy the same space at the same time, if they are in the same "quantum state" and the "State" by and large, consists of some of its properties. ||| However, even though particle physics is a very strange world, it turns out that it also has a law of the same kind: the Pauli exclusion principle, which states that two particles cannot occupy the same space at the same time if they are in the same "quantum state" - this "state" consisting roughly of certain of their characteristics.
On this basis, the physicists share the particles in two categories. ||| Based on this, physicists classify particles into two categories.
In one corner are good citizens, are referred to as the Fermi one and just obey the principle of Pauli. ||| In one corner we have good citizens called fermions, who wisely obey the Pauli principle.
and in the other the Bosonen, a nasty bunch of anarchists, where nothing is sacred, in any case, not this principle, which means that they can find themselves in the same place at the same time. ||| While lurking in the other are the bosons, a nasty band of anarchists who respect nothing - at all events, not this principle, which means that they can indeed be found in the same place at the same time.
These Bosonen links, according to the website the particle adventure of the Berkeley lab (which, incidentally, is absolutely astonishing) into two groups: the Mesonen, we will not deal with, and "force particles", by which the great forces of nature and with which the Higgs-Boson somehow would be used. ||| These bosons are then divided into two groups, according to the Berkeley Labs Particle Adventure site (absolutely extraordinary, by the way): mesons, which we will not discuss here, and "force particles" by which the great forces of nature are propagated and to which the Higgs boson may be somehow related.
Here, it must be emphasised, however, that not all these Bosonen exotic creatures, such as one might think. ||| These bosons, it must be stressed here, are not all such exotic bugs as you might think.
If you are able to read this story, then it is only thanks to a Bosons by exceptional banality: the Photon, or "light particles, the" messenger "of the electromagnetic force. ||| In fact, if you can read this article, it is thanks to an extraordinarily banal boson: the photon, or the "light particle" which is the "messenger" of the electromagnetic force.
If a particle with an electrical load will be speeded up or change the direction, "disrupted" the electromagnetic field in this place, as a pebble in a pond was thrown out. ||| When, in fact, a particle having an electric charge accelerates or changes direction, this "disturbs" the electromagnetic field in this specific place, rather like a pebble thrown in a pond.
This "disturbance" creates an electromagnetic wave (light, infrared or ultraviolet radiation, etc.), and this wave is nothing more than a photon and therefore one of the Bosonen "sources of power." ||| This "disturbance" produces an electromagnetic wave (of light, infrared, ultraviolet etc.), and this wave is nothing other than a photon - and thus one of the "force carrier" bosons.
more stable field ||| More stable field
The same applies to the Higgs-Boson, with the difference that a different field, "disrupted" the Higgs field, must be, so that this Boson. ||| The same applies to the Higgs boson, with the difference that it is another field, the Higgs field, which must be "disturbed" for the boson to appear.
But the Higgs field is much more stable than the electromagnetic field; the virus needs to achieve a very high energies, a bit like a frozen pond, whose surface only by a very large rock Zerfurcht. ||| Now, this Higgs field is much, much more stable than the electromagnetic field; to excite it, it is necessary to achieve very, very high energy levels, rather like a frozen pond which would need a very large rock to wrinkle the surface.
A huge particle accelerator as CERN is therefore needed-the large hadron collider is a ring with a volume of 27 km, in order to achieve such energy. ||| Which is why a huge particle accelerator like the one at CERN - the Large Hadron Collider is a ring with a 27km circumference! - is needed to achieve such energy levels.
Once again, the analogy with the electromagnetic field is helpful in order to explain the relationship between the Higgs and the mass. ||| The analogy with the electromagnetic field is again useful for explaining the relationship between the Higgs and mass.
There are, in fact, not all particles and not all materials interact with the electromagnetic field. ||| In fact not all particles, or all materials, interact with the electromagnetic field.
Some, like magnets, do this, but others do not, for example, a piece of paper would never think of themselves on the fridge. ||| Some, such as magnets, do so, but others don't - a piece of paper, for example, will never stick to a fridge.
and equally not all particles interact with the Higgs field: those who do have a mass, while the other (as is the photon) do not have mass. ||| And likewise, not all particles interact with the Higgs field: those that do so have mass, while the others (such as the photon) do not.
for what all this research can now "be good," Mrs Plamondon asks? ||| Now, what is it that all this research "can bring"? asks Ms Plamondon.
for the Science they serve the review of the standard model (SM), and they also allow physicists all deviations between the observations and to look closely at the predictions of the SM. ||| For science, it serves to check the validity of the Standard Model (SM), and also allows physicians to examine any discrepancies between the observations and predictions of the SM.
There are, in fact, many physicists eagerly hope that such derogations to be found, as the slightest difference open a door to a "new physics" and could fill some of the holes in the model. ||| A number of people, moreover, fervently hope that some will be found, because the slightest difference could open a door to a "new physics" and plug certain holes in the Model.
We must say that the latter is still major shortcomings, because there is no explanation for the gravity (UPS) and the dark matter provides around 80% of the matter of the universe (again ups!). ||| This, it must be said, still has huge shortcomings, offering no explanation for gravity (oops!) or dark matter, which forms approximately 80% of the matter in the Universe (re-oops!).
However, the CERN such derogations which, until now, has not been found. ||| But to date no such discrepancies have been found at CERN.

They saw scientific applications, but nothing else. ||| They had an inkling of the scientific applications, but nothing as to the rest.
In fact, the late physicist Willard Boyle, who has worked in the Bell Labs, in which the laser was invented in the 1960s, and the 1962 itself has developed the first permanent line were the first laser (Gepulst)-said that the laser at the beginning was seen more as a "gimmick" laboratory. ||| In fact, the late Willard Boyle - a physicist who worked at Bell Labs, where the laser was invented in 1960, and who himself developed the first continuous laser (the first were pulsed) in 1962 - told us that initially the laser was rather seen as a "lab gadget."

Our MöWe flew and no one on earth would have been able to answer the following question: is the space flight? ||| Our "Seagull" left and nobody on earth could tell whether she would be OK after flying to space.
After this flight, it will bring a child into the world? ||| Whether she will be able to give birth after this flight.
"Finally, no one answered this question," says space veteran guard Tang Watschnadse. ||| "Nobody answered this question," says rocket and space industry veteran, Vakhtang Vachnadze.

Nevertheless remains a risk. ||| However, the risk remains.
We have only very few cosmonaut, after long flights, in which everything went well and healthy offspring. ||| We have few, very few cosmonauts, who were OK and had healthy children after long flights.
"The more, the more dangerous it is even on flights in the orbit," concludes kosmonaut Valery Poljakow, hero of the Soviet Union and a hero of the Russian Federation. ||| "What's more, it is dangerous even for orbital flights," adds pilot and cosmonaut, Hero of the USSR, Hero of Russia, Valery Poliakov.
But the mankind for new ways in the field of biotechnology, the radiation protection and generate artificial gravity. ||| And yet, humanity needs to seek out some new avenues in biotechnologies, protection from radiation, creation of artificial gravity.
The hydro-engineering laboratory in preparation for the centre of the cosmonaut preparation is a compulsory station during the flight. ||| Hydro-laboratory of CPK - mandatory phase of training for a flight.
The cosmonaut routine wins here in a state of flux for the work in open space. ||| Here, cosmonauts practice skills of working in open space in zero-gravity conditions.
The water is the zero gravity. ||| Water imitates weightlessness.
If adults water as pleasant, it is also a foreign environment, but babies feel water as a natural element. ||| If for adults water is a foreign medium, although comfortable, for infants it is a native element.
It is, as would the small Ichtyander testimony to that life on the ocean emerged out of the country. ||| Small amphibians seem to confirm that life came to land from the ocean.

While a newborn child the zero gravity is a much more natural state, the woman not without gravity. ||| In other words, if for a newborn weightlessness is more natural, a woman needs gravity, earth's pull.
In a situation of zero gravity is the Bauch- and basin muscles very quickly and that is also the capacity to extract the child. ||| Stomach and pelvic muscles usually quickly degenerate in weightlessness; the ability to push out the embryo is reduced.
Well, we avoid the introductory tool by birth. ||| Well, let's assume that childbirth stimulators will work out.
The birth, for example, could also take place in a special chamber, extract for the child. ||| Maybe she will push out the baby in a special room.
"But what happens then?" is the not insignificant matter of Valery Poljakow. ||| "Then what?" - asks Valery Poliakov about this non-trivial issue.
On the other hand the child also artificial gravity. ||| On the other hand, a baby also needs artificial gravity.
without requiring that they can train the organism the skeleton and muscles do not. ||| When a body does not feel the earth's pull, it does not form the skeletal and muscular system.
a newborn baby in-orbit not as an adult to training in a suit. ||| It is not possible to dress a newborn in orbit into a special loading suit for training, as they do with adults.
He is simply the absence, which is vital for his life. ||| He will simply not have what he needs to survive.
"This experiment, we jointly, the birth of a child in a foreign environment, will lead to a disabled person, a completely Unangepassten will bring people to the world," says the head of the Ethics Commission of the Institute of Medical-biological problems slice, Igor Pestow. ||| "And this experiment, that we will go for by allowing the birth of a child in a foreign environment, will lead to us bringing a handicapped, completely unadapted human to earth," predicts Chairman of the Committee on Bioethics IMBP RAN Igor Pestov.
So far, the birth of children in space is just a theory. ||| For the moment, birth of children in space is just a theory.
But at some point it will become reality if the people in their spacecraft to a distant planet, the home for their offspring born in all. ||| However, with time, it will become reality, when earthlings will go to a faraway planet in their ships, and it will become the home for their offspring, who were born in space.
Nkú Chief: control of the black-system failed due to the fault of the policy ||| NKU Head: Svarc System audit has failed because of politicians.
The Czech Republic has good control bodies and adequate laws in connection with public contracts, but back in their application. ||| The Czech Republic has sound control bodies and a good standard of legislation when it comes to public contracts, but it lags behind in their application.
In the conversation for AktuáLně.Cz says the Vice-President of the highest Control Office (Nejvyšší Kontrolní úřAd Nkú), Miloslav Kala. ||| This was said by Miloslav Kala, vice-president of the Supreme Audit Office (NKU) in an interview for Aktualne.cz.
"A law is never perfect, but it must be applied correctly-and I think that this is not the case with us," Kala comment on the current situation. ||| "The Law will never be perfect, but its application should be just - this is what we are missing, in my opinion," states Kala, commenting on the current situation.
A similar result also appears to have a common control by Czech and German examiners. ||| Similar conclusions are also reached by the joint audit from the Czech and German auditors.
He leads a negative practice example the attitude of Prime Minister Petr NečAs for the so-called "black-system." ||| As an example of improper practice, they cite Petr Necas's approach to the so-called "Svarc System."
Recently, the Prime Minister said that the ODS entrepreneurs would not trouble with controls-so the system is now banned or allowed? ||| The Prime Minister recently claimed that the ODS will not be burdening business owners with its checks - so is it forbidden or allowed?
"A law must have valid, and if something is prohibited by law, but is not simply the government chairman, and the control, whose duty is to hamper the monitoring of compliance with the law, in his work", Kala. ||| "The Law must be set out one way or the other and if it prohibits something, then even the Government's head cannot prevent the work of its department, which is duty-bound to monitor and enforce," asserts Kala.
They spoke at the meeting of the monitoring committee of the Chamber of Deputies about a joint Czech-German project, under which the laws of both countries on public contracts were compared. ||| At the audit committee's session in the House of Deputies, you spoke about a joint project between the Czech Republic and Germany, within which legislation relating to public contracts in both countries was compared.
So what was it exactly? ||| What exactly was this about?
there is a parallel investigation, with which we started about two years ago. ||| This is about parallel auditing, which we began around two years ago.
Simply put, it is a question that the European legislation, as public contracts to manage and build the national legislation. And finally, there is the real practical application. ||| Simply put, this is about how European legislation governs the handling of public contracts, followed by individual state legislations and then the actual practice itself.
all of this, we have compared with each other, and, although the investigation is not finished yet, we have seen very interesting differences. Generally speaking, perhaps even "with US laws are strict and perfect ', but the actual application is better in Germany in some of the parameters. ||| We brought all this together, and although the audit is not yet complete, some very interesting differences have become apparent - in general terms, our legislation might be even "more concise and complete," however the actual practice is in certain aspects better in Germany.
This confirms that it is not enough, always new and more precise rules. We must also deal with the actual application of the law. ||| This confirms that creating more and more concise rules is not enough, and that attention must be paid to the actual application of these laws.
How can you help the project? What is for them from this project? ||| What does this project actually help you with, and what do you think its outcome will bring?
just such a common control could help that we stop constantly perfecting the laws in order to try and the reduction and balancing of thresholds, if this evidently not particularly positive. ||| This kind of joint audit could contribute to curtailing these efforts to specify our law, to reduce and perfect boundaries, when it does not have such a positive impact.
efficiency means one thing to a reasonable price (which is not always the lowest price) to acquire and illegal enrichment or even criminal acts. ||| Economy means acquiring the required thing at a reasonable (which does not always mean the lowest) price, so that profiteering and possible criminal proceedings may be avoided.
But the lowering of the threshold values for contracts does not guarantee that we are achieving this objective. ||| However, just because we have reduced the order limits, does not mean something will be procured.
Perhaps it is that the system in this way only with excessive 'paperwork', and those seeking loopholes in the system, it is much easier to exploit the system, remained higher than if the threshold values. ||| The system might become overloaded with the amount of paperwork, and those, who wish to look for loopholes in it, will be able to take advantage far more easily than if the limits had remained higher.
you talk about the problems in the practical implementation of the Czech law. ||| These are domestic problems about the practical implementation of legislation relating to public contracts.
How does the system work in Germany? ||| How does the audit system work in Germany?
There is a similar authority as our Nkú, or the system works differently? ||| Is there an office like the NKU, or is it organised differently?
As far as the authorities are concerned, the German equivalent to Nkú the federal court that is built, and also has a college that is slightly different in principle both authorities to be formed, but similar. ||| As far as the office is concerned, the Bundesrechnungshof functions like our NKU, and it is organised like ours, it also has a committee although it is appointed slightly differently, but basically both offices operate similarly.
The skills are comparable to a certain extent, but Germany is a federal state, in other words that there is this federal courts in the individual countries, the German system is different from our own. ||| Powers are also similar to a degree, though of course Germany is organised federally, so these courts of auditors are also at the member state levels - in this respect their system slightly differs from our own.
The Brh can only control federal funds, consistent with our national resources. ||| The BRH can only audit federal money, known to us as state funds.
public funds, which will be managed by the counties and municipalities, under the control of the country's courts. ||| Public funds, which, for us, are administered by regional and municipal authorities, are audited by the federal courts of auditors there.
What the German legislation is easier than ours? ||| When it comes to their legislation, is it more straightforward than ours?
In general I would compare without specific information only reluctantly. Nevertheless, Germany is often described as a model in some ways, but it is certainly not to say that Germany in particular is better. ||| Overall, I would not like to make a comparison without any specific data, nevertheless in certain respects Germany serves as an example, but it certainly cannot be said that it is better in every aspect.
This is perhaps because the auditors are better? ||| Is this because, perhaps, they have better enforcement?
Certainly not, but as I said, such comparisons may I do not particularly like. ||| That is certainly not true, but again, I prefer not to make such comparisons.
This is worth noting that even those countries that are a model for us, also have problems to contend with. ||| It should be said that even in a country we perceive as exemplary, they encounter a whole range of problems.
Otherwise you would have nothing of the cooperation with our authority, not true? ||| If that were not the case, they would gain nothing from working with our office, would they?
What the Czech legislation, which was important for their authority to review the procurement law, feel they have any impact? ||| Coming back to domestic legislation, what did the amendment to public contracts legislation mean for your office, is its impact being felt already?
In view of the fact that this amendment is, in force for only a short time, it is not in our tests so far. ||| The period since the amendment came into force has been quite short, so it has not manifested itself in our audit work yet.
Since our controls take place, we must here with some delay. ||| Since we carry out our audits ex-post, a certain delay has to be taken into account.
We feel effects have so far been rather controls in the preparatory phase of the future-we have introduced the new instrument of control "identification of risks of waste," and with this almost 14,000 public contracts examined and analysed-This will effect the changes, of course, since the threshold values change the conditions for certain types of tenders have been modified and others ||| As yet, we have only observed it within the process of preparing future audits - we have launched our new "fiscal failure risk detection" system, with which we have processed almost 14 thousand public contracts, and these have been analysed - that is where changes will clearly be seen, because of the changed limits, the adjusted conditions governing certain types of selection processes, and so on.
you see the adoption of this law rather positive, or the system will be burdened with additional bureaucracy? ||| So do you see the adoption of this legislation as a benefit, or rather as another burden on the bureaucratic system?
I think that this law is certainly a step in the right direction, and I hope that this adoption. ||| I believe this legislation is a step in the right direction, and I hope this will be confirmed.
The problem, however, is that the rules can be "strict" and can no longer be met. ||| A problem, which may arise here, is that the law becomes "too constrained" and will not be enforceable.
Under the previous rules are a test Unterzogenen persons against the winner (for example, in the event of the operational programme of regional policy, the Regional Council) accountable, that any failure of the procurement law is tantamount to a breach of discipline. ||| Under the previous rules, parties being audited were already bound by their audit provider (for example, in the case of regional operational programmes, the regional office) to the fact that every infringement of public contracts law means a breach of budgetary discipline.

Later, an improved version, the RM-1A, was built in 1959 and began in the BłęDóW desert flight tests of the two-stage missile RM-2. ||| Later, the improved RM-1A version was constructed and in the summer of 1959 launch tests were initiated for the two-stage RM-2 rocket in the Bledowsky Desert.
The missile was 1.4 metres long and weighed around 11.5 kg. ||| The rocket was 1.4 metres in length and weighed approximately 11.5 kg.
A further development stage should already be in a position to provide real scientific work-RM-34 rocket should reach a height of up to 14.5 km and for the monitoring of high winds. ||| A further development model was designed for real scientific work - the RM-34 rocket was to reach 14.5 km and be tasked with monitoring high altitude winds.
In 1962, however, was the further development. ||| Of course, in 1962 further research was stopped.
RM, the successor to the first missiles of the type Meteor-1-Rakete developed in the years from 1962 to 1965. ||| The successor to the RM rocket type was the Meteor-1 rocket, developed from 1962 to 1965.

This decision caused a lively debate in the public. ||| The resolution caused lively public debate.
It is interesting to look at the issue from a wider perspective. ||| It will certainly be interesting to look at this issue from a broader perspective.
The liberal-oriented economies in the EU and in the globalised world based on the principle of unregulated economic competition. ||| Liberally oriented financial systems in the EU, just as those in the globalised world, are based on the principle of an unregulated economic competition.
In the final analysis, this means that the individual economies in a permanent conflict with each other. ||| Its effect means that individual financial entities and national economic systems are in a state of permanent conflict among themselves.
This is the principle of free trade and the free, unrestricted movement of private capital, which goes hand in hand with rampant financial speculation. ||| The cause is the principle of free trade and free, completely unregulated movement of private capital together with uncontrolled financial speculation.
Due to the large differences of the value of work (wages) when it comes to price tensions. ||| Due to significant labour cost differences (salaries) there is pressure on prices.
To understand this concept is a condition in which the manufacturers trying to import cheaper goods in economic competition, by undercutting the competition "', in order to seize a larger market share and to increase their profits. ||| On this basis, it should be understood that when a supplier tries to compete in a commercial tender by importing cheap goods, "the rug is pulled" from under the competition's prices to capture a greater market share and, in this way, increase its own profits.
on a large scale, this means for most companies to transfer their manufacturing abroad or buy cheap, or abandon their business. The result is a high level of unemployment in countries with comparable high labour costs. ||| On a wider scale, this means most businesses must move production abroad, import cheaply from abroad, or close down. The result is high unemployment in countries where labour costs are high compared to other economies.
Since the private capital is not social responsibility and also bears no responsibility for the unemployment caused by him, are necessarily the spending increase. ||| Since private capital is not bound by social responsibility, and therefore also not by the unemployment it causes, the social costs born by the state must necessarily increase.
This situation is compounded by the fact that the gentlemen entrepreneurs are absolutely unwilling to pay their taxes and the overall economic and social damage caused by them. ||| The whole situation is bolstered by the businessman's complete unwillingness to pay taxes, which would alleviate the economical and social harm caused in the pursuit of profit.
This situation is well known, so that specific statistics are unnecessary at this point. ||| The situation is so well known that there is no need for actual statistical data.
The reckless practice of private capital in the individual economies will create a situation in which the governments are forced to compete with each other in order to artificially reduce the social level of their own people and to attract foreign capital into the country. ||| The ruthless private capital practices create particular economic situations, where the State in these countries is forced to enter in the mutual competition, aiming to artificially lower the social standard of its own citizens in order to attract foreign investment.
In other words, governments provide their own people without regard to the social consequences of the private capital. ||| In other words, governments stake their own citizens because of private capital while disregarding the drop in social standards.
This manifests itself in particular amendments to existing laws. ||| This occurs chiefly in amendments to existing law.
The aim of these measures is to force its own people, to accept the dictates of private capital, particularly in terms of wages. ||| The aim is to economically force the domestic population to accept prices dictated by private capital, especially in terms of salaries.
This is an economic force in long-term unemployment, on the other hand, by restricting the rights of workers. ||| On one hand, this economic system of force, in case of long-term unemployment, on the other, restricted employee rights in the workplace.
The result is increased poverty and widening disparities between rich and poor. ||| This yields growing poverty and an increasing void between the poor and the rich.
for several years in Germany, there are public food distribution to the poor, which are no longer in a position to feed, through their own work. ||| In Germany there are already a host of food hand-out centres for the poor, who are not able to feed themselves on their own wages.
The number of people already in the millions. ||| The number of these people is already in the millions.
in the wake of increasing the competitiveness of the German economy is regularly given to cases in which workers such a low salary, that the state must increase their income until the subsistence level. ||| In the name of improving the competitiveness of the German economy, it commonly occurs that properly employed people receive such a salary that the State needs to top it up to the minimum wage.
such a scandal was also in the case of workers exposed in the German Bundestag. ||| Just such a scandal was revealed in the case of auxiliary staff in the Bundestag.
The austerity measures of practically all EU-Southern States will undoubtedly be in the same situation, in which the people under the pressure of a disastrous crash of their social levels are forced to emigrate (as was the case in the 19th century), or for a pittance, on the fringes of society to languish, and I hope that at some point private investment capital will flow into the country. ||| The austerity measures for all the southern EU states will undoubtedly lead to the same situation, where people are pressured by a catastrophic drop in living standards to emigrate as it was in the 19th century, or to eke out an existence on starvation wages on the edge of society, in the hope that the country will eventually see some foreign investment.
This is naturally the question of where this capital? ||| At this point we have to ask where this may come from?
If it comes from another EU country, moves the poverty of; or the capital remains the same from one country to another, because in China, India, Brazil, Turkey, Morocco or Egypt and Africa at work for a fraction of the salaries of the employees. ||| If it is to come from other EU states, then poverty is being shifted from one country to another, or it will not come at all, because Chinese, Indian, Brazilian, Turkish, Moroccan, Egyptian, and African labour is still at a fraction of European wages.
This concerns the whole of Latin America. ||| This applies to all of Latin America.
ad nauseam Liberal theories and the media claim that the state must not involved with capital in its own economy and that economy could lead to economic disaster. ||| Liberal theory and the Media incessantly claim that the State may not participate with capital in its own economy, and that a controlled economy leads to economic ruin.
The private, parochial, insists on its position that the state should not intervene directly in the economy. ||| Private capital cruelly insists on the viewpoint that the State must not intervene in the economy.
then, however, we must ask whether the private policy and therefore the whole state influenced or even in their own selfish interests. ||| Thereupon, we should ask ourselves whether private capital has no influence, or whether it actually leads politics and thereby the whole country, for its own selfish ends.
The clear answer is: yes. ||| Here, the answer must be yes.
proof of this is the existence of a virtually omnipotent and omnipresent lobby in all member states. ||| The proof is the existence of the almost omnipotent, and in all states, omnipresent lobby.
The result is a desperate situation in the field of legislation, the corruption, the mutual benefit, virtually everything is criminally punishable, but nothing. ||| The result is a desperate situation manifesting itself through corruption, through mutual benefits and legislation, where almost everything is criminal, but nothing is punishable.
In Germany, the situation is such that a State Department lack of finances private, closely interdependent with the industry law firms charged with the preparation of draft legislation. ||| In Germany the situation is such that state ministries, through lack of financial resources, contract out the drafting of laws to private law firms, who are basically connected with industry.
The draft law will be then passed in the Bundestag. ||| These laws are then approved in the Bundestag.
all the violence is no longer, as the western constitutions, but from the people of strong financial groups with their own interests. ||| Real power does not come from the people as the Western-style constitutions claim, but from strong financial organisations that look after their own interests.
Obviously the liberal democracies soon in a situation at the moment, as you APP Ian in his work on the crisis of the Roman Republic when Caesar and Pompeius' describes: "The state was long in the break, and the offices were filled with violence. ||| It is clear that liberally-orientated democracies will now quickly reach a situation, as is described by Appian in his work on the Roman Republic Crisis in the time of Cesar and Pompei: "The State was already long in complete degeneration and its offices taken by force.
bribes, illegal or fraudulent use of benefits with stone and sword. ||| With bribery, illegal acquisition of benefits, and with stones or swords.
corruption has grown incontinent, and people with already buy votes on election "..." people with character applied for not for offices, so that the state as a result of this decline for eight months had no consul "..." we already really began to speak about the fact that the only medicine in this serious situation was a dictatorship, and that a strong man... should be chosen "APP Ian thought although Pompeius, but the strong man was then Caesar, the democracy permanently replaced by the dictatorship. ||| Bribery and corruption were rife and unhindered, and the people would vote for a result which had been bought" ..."people with principles did not run for office, so on one occasion the whole debacle meant the state went eight months without consuls.." .."There was actually talk about the only answer to this terrible situation being autocracy, and an energetic man should be elected." Appian had Pompei in mind, but it was Cesar who changed democracy for autocracy permanently.
As it turns out, based on today's society as well as in ancient times on the ruthless preference to their own advantage, without overall interests of society. ||| The conclusion, just as in antiquity, the current society is built on unscrupulous tendencies for personal gain without regard to the interests of society as a whole.
private capital is by its very nature, is not in a position to see the benefit of the whole of society. ||| Private capital in its present state is not able to understand the interests of society as a whole.
The result, now as then, is an unparalleled decadence of the elites, not in the slightest for deeper reforms. ||| The outcome is now, as it was then, an unprecedented decadence of the elite with no attempts whatsoever on deeper reaching reforms.
The reason for the rise of fascism and communism in the indiscriminate liberalisation of the economy, we must therefore find systems in the 19th and 20th century. ||| The causality of the rise of the fascist and communist regimes should therefore be sought in the misguided liberalisation of the economic system in the 19th and 20th centuries.
from today's situation, can be regarded as certain break the fall of this regime for the liberal democracies, already in the next round. ||| The current state of affairs, when we consider the demise of those systems in favour of liberalised democracy as an interlude, can expect its next cycle.
particularly disastrous is the fact that today's elites the loss of hundreds of thousands of lives in the future, the social and humanitarian disasters, we have already witnessed, and crimes against humanity, as we know from the history of older and newer, in complete ignorance. ||| The particularly catastrophic reality is that the current elite is completely ignoring the potential lost of hundreds of thousands of lives, humanitarian and social disasters, which we are already witnessing, as well as crimes against humanity, as we are familiar with from ancient and modern history.
The lifting of the law on voluntary work here is not the solution, or at least not lasting. ||| The abolition of the law on public works is not the answer, at least not in the long term.
Under pressure from the global and European economic competition, Czech Republic will be forced to continue to seek ways to push down the level of social security of the population. ||| Under the pressure of economic competition, internationally as well as within Europe, the Government of the Czech Republic will be forced to pursue ways of lowering the population's living standards.
