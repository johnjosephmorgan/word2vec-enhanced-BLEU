%We test our Word2vec enhanced BLEU algorithm on the output from an English to Pashto SMT system. 
We test our Word2vec enhanced BLEU algorithm on the output from a German to English SMT system. 
%We train a vector space model of Pashto with 
We use the vector space model trained by the demo script that is supplied with the word2vec distribution. 
This model is trained on 100 MB of text with the cbow neural network architecture. 
The vectors are embedded in a $200$-dimensional space. 
A window of size $5$ words is used.
